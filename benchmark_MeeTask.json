{"Sample 1": {"Audio_path": "audio_benchmark/ZT_at4ZgHu4_0.wav", "Context": " Hey everybody. Welcome to the podcast. Very excited because my guest today is Mary Cain, the Mary Cain. The track and field athlete who by high school  had established herself as the fastest girl in a generation. The Mary Cain who at 17 became the youngest American ever to make a world championship track and field team. The Mary Cain for whom  Olympic glory seemed a foregone conclusion, until that is, she joined Nike's elite Oregon Project under Alberto Salazar. Within that culture, her body ultimately collapsed, her running career behind it.  And for a couple of years thereafter, she just kind of disappeared, until November of 2019 that is when Mary broke her silence on what happened and why,  telling her story by way of a video op-ed in \"The New York Times\" entitled, \"I Was the Fastest Girl in America, Until I Joined Nike\". That video went crazy viral.  It resulted in a groundswell of global support for Mary, and opened the door to a broader ongoing conversation around the toxicity that pervades female athletics,  and the means by which we can construct a better future for women and girls in sports. Not content to merely tell her story or just get back to running, but to actually do something, make a real difference,  Mary just announced the launch of Atalanta, a New York City based elite running team and community nonprofit. It's an endeavor that she leads as CEO, with the dual mission of promoting running community, inclusivity and diversity,  and rewriting the rule book on professional women's athletics. Today, we get into all of it. Her story is powerful. This one is kind of a wild, emotional ride, and I'm really proud to help share it. So thanks for watching.  Hit that subscribe button, and here we go. This is me, Rich Roll by the way, and Mary Cain. (light melodic music) So nice to meet you.  Sorry you got the wrong address and got a little bit lost, but you're here- Oh, yeah. I've been waiting for this for a long time. I've been texting all our mutual friends telling them how excited I am to meet you. So thanks for doing this. Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, I'm just excited to be able to travel to LA.  This has been such a fun little long weekend. Is it your first time traveling since the whole shebang? About a month ago, I had traveled to Park City, and that had been one of those trips that were canceled, and you had to book within a year,  and all of a sudden April was rolling around and we're like, \"I guess we're still going.\" So that was my first time on a plane. So this was my second. Right. What was the vibe? I dunno. I felt it was good in that everybody's wearing their masks,  everybody seemed to be taking all the rules seriously. And I was on a Delta flight, so we were as spaced as we almost could be. So yeah, I found if anything, it felt pretty safe and that adds to the excitement maybe.  And what's the vibe in New York? Does it feel it's coming back, or this whole idea that New York City is dead. New York City is not dead. That is, oh man, if you guys follow the real estate market in New York City- It's crazy, right? Everybody's going bananas.  I think New York is going to have this crazy Renaissance- Oh 100%. Maybe not right away, but in the next year. Mary Wittenberg is like, \"This is the 1970s, and we're gonna have this big Renaissance of cultural influence now, again,  and just 50 years later, where you go through a really tough time and it resurges.\" And I think you see that even in the recent announcements about you don't have to wear masks outside anymore, and certain things shifting. You all of a sudden feel this energy of like,  \"Oh, I wanna come back,\" and I think even people who left are starting to get a little antsy of like, \"What am I gonna miss out on? Maybe I need to come back.\" Well, when summer hits and you get those nice warm nights in New York,  I think it's gonna be like the summer of love. Oh yeah, I mean, I'm right near Central Park too, so I probably have a timed skewed view of how many people are out and about, but gosh, if I go for my evening run and it's 60 degrees, I can barely get around the reservoir some days  'cause you're just like, \"Everybody wants to be out right now.\" Right, and it's cool, it's exciting funnily, right? Oh, and its fun even from the running perspective of yes, you have that moment where you're hurdling a kid in Central Park and you're like, \"This maybe could have been better,\"  but in general, the more people are out, the more energy that is, and then you feed off it. Yeah, you feel it, you get that surge of vitality that only New York can deliver. Yes, absolutely 'cause it's just so dense, and so diverse,  and there's so many people kind of following their own dreams and passions, and as a result, I just feel like there's inspiration everywhere you turn. Yeah, you don't get that here, that's why I feel I have to visit a couple of times a year to get that feeling,  and then come back renewed and exhausted. Yeah, fair. I mean, the thing I will say, and I'm born and raised in the New York City area, I grew up in the suburbs right outside of the city, and so I've probably always had a bit of a bias view,  but nowhere else in the country is a city. We are the only place that is truly an urban environment. There's no sprawl in the same way that we have suburbs, but the actual density of each block is just,  like maybe Chicago could hold their own, but sometimes even my friends and coworkers in Boston will be kind of comparing Boston to New York and I'm like, \"oh,-\" That's cute. \"You're a small town.\" Well, the thing about,  I mean, New York City is my favorite place to go running. Even though I love the trails, and the nature, and all of that, when you go running in New York City, every time you go outside your door, it's an adventure, and you're gonna see all kinds of stuff,  and sometimes I just I love the park, I like Riverside, I like all the typical places that you run. But sometimes I to just run the streets and not have any agenda about which way I'm gonna turn, just based on the lights or whatever,  and just go down random streets and just take it all in. And there's so much stimuli everywhere you look that you lose track of how long you've been running, and I don't know, I just love it. Oh, I completely agree.  I've always said that New York City is the best running city in the world. And when I use the word city there, I'll give other places a chance to claim city hood. That's so kind of you, you provincial New Yorker. I have to be generous.  Now you're getting snobby, careful. Yeah, exactly. But I think for me, it's one, the fact that it's the only, it's one of the only places in the world where there's such a vibrant amateur set up,  where there's true teams, and there's competitions weekly, and we have New York road runners there who can help put on just like races week after week after week. And I think since there's such a organized ability to participate in sports,  post collegiately, particularly running, it just creates this dynamic to where you never are in Central Park alone. It doesn't matter what time it is. If it's 5:00 a.m. I'm shocked by the number of people who will be out in giant groups  having way too much fun, even though it's 5:00 a.m. and I'm not normally a 5:00 a.m. runner, but the times that has happened, I'm really I think carried by that energy. Yeah, the running culture is just interwoven with the urban culture of New York.  And it's crazy when you go into the park and you see people running and it's like, \"Wow, these are real runner.\" You're like, \"That guy's legit.\" Some dude add you're like, \"I don't know what he's training for,  but whoever's racing against that guy I feel sorry for.\" True elites everywhere you go. And everybody else at the same time like it's kind of a cool, beautiful thing. Yeah, and I think that's what's exciting about New York too,  where it spans kind of from the highest end professionals to people who are just starting running. And I don't feel there's almost this setup where it's like in order to join a team,  you have to have had X, Y, and Z standards. If anything, it's like so many of the groups are catering more to this community environment, and just being inclusive, and welcoming people who maybe this is their first time ever stepping out to go for a run.  And to me that's just important because I think elsewhere, it can become maybe more intimidating to join a team because you only run if you're this quote unquote \"Runner,\" which I hate when people say that, I'm like, \"If you run, you're a runner.  There's no threshold, I'm not asking for your splits.\" And I think in New York we kind of have that mindset of if you run, you're a runner, and elsewhere it can get a little bit more maybe people kind of hedge, and they're like,  \"Ah, maybe not good enough to be on that team, they seem pretty serious, so I'm not gonna join something.\" That intimidation, right? Well spoken like a true community manager. What's your title a Tracksmith, something like that, Vice President of Community or something?  Yeah, I'm the New York City Community Manager. That's so funny, right? You have a job title. I know I actually, well, it's kind of crazy. I have three job titles now. New York City Community Manager for Tracksmith,  I'm a Virtual Coach Specialist to New York Road Runners where I work part time. And now I'm CEO of an organization I'm starting, Atalanta New York. Atalanta, we're gonna talk about that. Before we do that though,  I went running with our mutual BFF, Alexi Pappas, the other day. And it's funny, I didn't really think about whether you guys were friends or not. I guess I just assumed, \"Oh yeah, they must know each other,\"  but I didn't realize the depth of your friendship, and how far back it goes until I read that beautiful \"Runner's World\" article, which is amazing, everybody should check that out, I'll link it up in the show notes. You guys go way back. And we're of course chatting,  and she's telling me about her movie and all kinds of stuff, and then she, but she knew that you were coming on the show, which I was like, \"Oh, cool you know that?\" And she's just telling me a little bit. I was like, \"What should I ask her? What should we talk about?\" And she was like, \"Well, everybody  obviously wants to know about the thing, right?\" Which we're gonna have to talk about because this isn't an exclusively running oriented podcast, so there's gonna be people who don't know that story. But also this sense of you not wanting to,  understanding people wanna hear that story, but not wanting to dwell on the past, and really being more focused on all the great things that you're doing now that you're doing so well. And I was like, \"Cool.\" And after our run and Alexi texted me  'cause she had additional thoughts. Of course she always has. Right of course. And she said, \"Mary is doing great, but there's always grieving to do. And I think she's doing a phenomenal job of observing and allowing that grief while also growing up and crafting a life she wants  before her own eyes, so it's both. She's great, and she knows she has all that inside.\" That's amazing. Alexi just has a way with words that I feel the number of times after we've had a 90 minute conversation over the phone,  and we say our goodbyes, five minutes later, she ends up sending a paragraph that just literally makes me tear up about how much our friendship means to her, or just some inspirational thing based on a different topic that we had talked about  over the course of the conversation. And I always feel my reply is probably not as eloquent. But she knows. Well, she always said she was gonna go get her PhD in poetry, and her book, I mean, not everybody can write a book like that, it's quite something. It was beautiful.  I mean, I was one of the first people who got to read it, and I think I finished it in two days, and I just the whole time would be texting her stuff. And some of the stories, even though we are very good friends, I didn't know,  and a lot of it was on that personal level for her where many people who were very close to her didn't have that full picture. And being able to get to be one of the first people to see that,  and experience that, and then talk to her about it felt very special. And conversely, she was not aware of all the things that you were going through at the time. It's that thing where you're in that pain,  and you silo yourself off even from your closest friend 'cause you guys were close back then, but neither of you were really communicating with each other on that deeper level about what you were enduring privately. Yeah, absolutely. And I think in many ways  the reason we are both very vocal now about mental health, depression, and the need to talk about it, and the need to seek help, and lean on other people is because we reflect on our own journeys, which have shockingly overlapped,  even on a year to year it's like, \"Wow, 2016, what happened in that year?\" And as you kind of look, I think as we look back, there's this ability to see maybe if we could've, should've, would've  and leaned on each other, things would have gone a little differently. And that's not to say you can talk yourself out of depression, that's not to say you can talk yourself out of a mental health struggle, but at least being able to know somebody else is going through it,  and maybe working together to find the resources to get us help, could have saved us both sooner. And knowing that makes me always think how can I help somebody else take that step earlier? Yeah.  Well, I think Alexi writing her book and you sharing your story in the way that you have been doing is the path forward because that gives other people the comfort, and the empowerment required to share something that  privately they feel maybe they can't, right? I know you're a big Bren\u00e9 Brown fan. Yes. And she's all about that can you summon the courage to be vulnerable on that level? Yeah, and I think for me it's always come back to,  and I just say this in that as honest way as I can that for me, it always was like, \"Yes, this is gonna help me in my own healing journey, completely. If I share, then it's kind of like putting,\"  sometimes putting words out there can create truth in a way that thoughts can't quite do and, it's the same reason why during a workout sometimes you have to verbalize, \"I got this,\" just feel that extra energy. And so that kind of maybe selfish reason  is part of the reason I shared my story, but so much more so it was, it's scary to realize that so many mental health injuries, as Alexi would call them, are something that even if you have it,  you can't recognize in the same way. And I think physical injuries, especially as runners, we can relate to this, who hasn't run through an injury for two weeks longer than they should have 'cause they convinced themselves it was something else, or something they could work through,  or et cetera, et cetera, but issues that relate to mental health, I feel like since you can't physically see it, since you can't get that MRI diagnosis, and even since it's harder to find medical professionals  who are always going to really know how to help you as an individual, I think it's just harder to sometimes recognize what you're actually going through. And so, the big reason that I came forward,  and I know the big reason that Alexi is sharing her story, is because if it can help one other person put a name to what their experience is, then the ability for them to seek help is so much higher.  And I know for me personally I always kind of explain to people that I knew in 2016 that I had forms of disordered eating, but I didn't know why, I didn't know what that kind of deeper,  darker depression was underneath that was predisposing me to have these tendencies. And it wasn't until I was able to actually realize that emotional abuse by the hands of a coach  was what was always holding me back from truly both getting the help that I needed, but also knowing how to get the help that I needed. It just made all those years before not pointless,  but not as successful as they could have been, fruitful, and positive, and all those great things. And instead it wasn't until 2019, really around the time that I was sharing in the story,  that I was suddenly able to really get help. Well, you can point, you can kind of identify a couple primary reasons for that. I mean, first of all there was,  of course there are women who have spoken publicly about RED-S, and disordered eating in sport, and all that all the like, but perhaps not on the scale with which your story seemed to connect. I mean, it so crazy viral when the video was published.  And I wanna talk about that, but at the same time, from a systemic point of view, you're on this team that on paper look like everything was dialed in, and all the support that any professional athlete  at the elite level, whatever need to succeed, including quote unquote, \"Performance psychologists and nutritionists,\" that turned out weren't that at all, right? So you can't really be too hard on yourself  because being as young as you were, and not knowing, not being able to point two examples out in the world that would help you kind of map out where you were at, and not having the internal support  and the kind of situation, the dynamic that was at play at the Oregon project at the time, you were kind of left to fend for yourself with all of this. Yeah, and I think now, today as I sit here, I totally recognize that. And I think the tough thing is,  and I think why in so many ways the video went more viral than I had expected, is because logically that's true, but emotionally, it can take years for somebody to recognize  that they're not at fault. And I think a lot of that is just societally we have almost created this horrible and toxic perspective that all mental health is somehow a personal feeling, and it kind of goes back to that Calvinistic  where you are is because of who you are in a way, and I hate that thinking and it's horrible, but I think that really kind of filters into our society at large.  And as a result what's really difficult for I think a lot of young people is that when you're in these really toxic, and horrible, and abusive situations, as you're breaking down, you start to see this quote unquote  \"Truth in what they're saying\" because you are like, \"Yeah, I am super emotional. I'm crying every single day. Maybe I am the problem 'cause I'm the one crying,\" or, \"Yes, I'm the one that they're telling is overweight.  So, that must be something I'm doing wrong.\" And I think it's so easy to get therefore into this really toxic self blame perspective, and that's not to say there are things I look back and I'm like,  \"Oh, maybe, had I just know to be more confident, or do this,\" and you always kick yourself in some ways, but I think I've made peace with my past in a way that  being able to share publicly, and almost develop this relationship with thousands and millions of people who were able to watch that and kind of see themselves in my story  is both really tragic, but also beautiful in that healing process of knowing you're not alone. Right. We should probably sort of establish the terrain that we're talking about for people that are watching or listening  who aren't familiar with the trajectory of your story, and how it became a viral moment. So why don't we just spend a few minutes talking about your background? So you grow up outside of New York City, Bronxville. You run in high school, you're crushing it,  you're breaking all these high school records, it's absolutely insane winning high school titles. And you essentially go pro right out of high school, and start working with Alberto Salazar.  You move to Portland when you're 17, 16? And that's where things start to get a little bit janky, right? So talk a little bit about the lead up to moving to Portland,  and kind of the early days of working with Alberto at the Nike Oregon Project. Yeah, so I first met him the beginning of my junior year, and I still lived in New York, I was still a high school junior,  and we had this long distance relationship, my junior and senior year, during which I ended up qualifying for the world championships at the end of my junior year, signing a professional contract with Nike  my fall senior year, and then going on to have a really incredible senior year season. And he's coaching you remotely at that point. Yeah, and there are times where maybe we were at the same meet together, or I travel out to,  like that summer that I competed on the world stage I traveled out and was kind of like with their team for maybe three or four weeks or something, but it was always these kind of like little moments, and it was always so much fun, right?  Because you have your coach on the ground with me in New York, John Henwood, who was kind of that buffer. I had my parents there who were always that kind of buffer between me and the team, but everything sounded great,  and everything was going great in high school. I was working with this, now I have to say quote unquote, \"Foreign psychologist,\" there was more positivity and everything was kind of like, \"Oh, this is fun.\"  And then I ended up after my indoor season senior year developing a stress reaction in my shin. And that was kind of a moment that things changed. And I think truthfully,  and just at least how I kind of look back on it, I think having a little bit of time off my body started develop a little bit, right? Nothing, I didn't all of a sudden gain 10 pounds or anything like that,  it wasn't something you could even necessarily visually see, but physically I could tell there was some sort of changes starting to happen 'cause I'm all of a sudden at the end of that high school, going into college years,  this is when a lot of women start to develop. And so, all of a sudden weight started to become a conversation in a way that in the past it hadn't really been, and it would kind of start off small of being like, \"Oh, you're cross-training,  you have to be more conscientious of your weight,\" and it just kept building and building and building. So by the time I was kind of in full swing of the outdoor season, I ended up coming in second at the US championships,  ran a 4:06, and was feeling really good and really positive. But I kept being told that I couldn't go to Europe that year to race because I wasn't fit enough. From Alberto. Yes. And it was this kind of like, \"You're not fit,  you're not fit, you're not fit.\" And I didn't, I kind of was like, \"I kept sinking at the US championship, I think I'm unfit.\" There's one person maybe a little bit more fit than me? Literally, yes. And so, I just didn't really get it,  and I ended up racing at the World Junior Championships. And the day before the race I was told to do two 100 meters all out. And I was told to break 13 seconds for the 100. And I ended up running 12:5 for both of them. So I didn't think anything of it,  besides the fact that it's kind of weird to do all out sprints the day before a race, but after the race, Alberto, kind of that week, I was like, \"Hey, World Junior Champion, I'm second at USA, let's dive in, let's go to Europe, let's do what we did last year.\"  And that was when it finally became clear that this fitness was about weight. And it was because he told me that the reason he had me do those 100s the day before is that he wanted to have the talk the day before the race  that I was too heavy, and he wanted me to do those 100s 'cause he didn't think I would be physically capable of breaking 13 'cause he thought I was too big to do it. But then you go 12:5,  and he didn't eat his lunch after that. No, he still told me after the race that even though I did that, it's clear I'm not skinny enough to travel. So of course I'm,  just graduated high school, literally moved out to Oregon right after winning world juniors. And rather than traveling to Europe, we decide I'm gonna stay in Portland over the summer,  and I'm going to get fit, aka lose weight. And there was kind of this idea that if I lost one pound per week, I could get down to 113 pounds to race at Fifth Ave, and therefore I might be competitive.  And granted again, I came in second at USA, so I don't, in retrospect, I should have just thought what the heck, but this is hypothetically the best coach in the world. Sure. I mean, we're gonna dive deeper into the whole weight thing,  but on some level, when you tell that story, it almost feels like a way in which he can exert greater control. Is it a control issue as much as it is a weight issue because as long as he can Lord that over you,  then he can kind of be the puppeteer. Yeah, absolutely. And I think we recognize that now, in retrospect with other kind of behaviors that happened. Like when I was in high school he communicated,  and all the team communicated a lot with my parents, right? To be like after a good workout, there would be this like, \"Wow, Mary did awesome. So cool. Congrats.\" And it felt this really kind of like family, team dynamic,  and everything's just so positive. As soon as I went out to Portland, all communication with my parents stopped. And what happened was that after world juniors,  as the dedicated athlete that I was who, yes again, in retrospect I was racing at this really high level, but to me I'd been top 10 in the world, I'm trying to be a world champion, that's kind of like my end game.  So when somebody is telling me, \"You are not fit enough, 'Well, yeah, I was second at USA's, maybe that's top 20 in the world, and I'm constantly pushing.'\" So I did what I was told  and I lost probably six to seven pounds 'cause I think I was about 120 at the time, scaled down to 113. And that was when disordered eating started.  And how was your performance that year? Oh, it ended up pretty cool. I mean, now I look back I'm like, \"It wasn't that bad,\" but it was horrible compared to the years before. But what happened was after Fifth Ave,  I didn't race that well, I came in eighth, and I didn't look good. My parents saw me 'cause we were back in New York, and truthfully they had felt a little distanced from me and from the program,  and it was kind of this weird last two months of being a little bit ghosted. And my mom saw me and was just like, \"You don't look good. You look pale, dark circles under your eyes. What's kind of going on?\"'  And I admitted that I've been really working to lose weight. I've been told I was too heavy to travel. And my parents naturally got really upset about that because they're like, \"What are you even talking about? You raced great.  Why is that a conversation?\" And a phone call was had with the, I'll call him high-performance coach on the team, and the coach- Right this person sort of held himself to be a psychologist, but it turns out he was not indeed a psychologist.  Yes, exactly, and I thought he was a medical professional and therefore treated our conversations as such. But I afterwards got in big trouble for telling my parents  about my struggles with weight and everything. And I got this big lecture, which continued throughout that year, where if I ever kind of like maybe told my parents something that I was uncomfortable with,  or whether it was about taking birth control, or an inhaler, or a thyroid medication, or whatever it was, if I told them that then I would get yelled at because I had to be an adult, I had to be a professional, ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "Who is Mary Kane?", "Question 2": "What significant achievement did she accomplish at seventeen?", "Question 3": "What happened when she joined the Nike Oregon Project?", "Question 4": "When did Mary break her silence about her experience?", "Question 5": "What was the title of Mary's New York Times piece?", "Question 6": "What is the mission of the new running team she launched?", "Question 7": "How did New York City feel after the pandemic?", "Question 8": "What was the primary struggle Mary faced with her coach?", "Question 9": "How did her friends help during their healing process?", "Question 10": "What is Mary's message about mental health and support?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "Mary Kane is a track and field athlete who established herself as the fastest girl in her generation by high school, becoming the youngest American ever to make a world championship track and field team at seventeen.

And as an 18 year old who's at college, most freshmen. Yeah, that's great. I mean, you're 18 years old, that's a crazy control thing, right? \"You're 18 years old, how dare you tell your parents  what's going on in your life?\" And what's interesting about that is the fact that Salazar's defense or rebuttal in the wake of you coming out and sharing your story is that he's claiming that  he was in constant communion with your parents and talking to them about weight, your dad's a doctor, right? So is that just not true? No. I mean, it sounds like from your point of view that it didn't happen at all. So, when I was in high school again, they talked a lot.  There was a lot of this back and forth, emailing, calling, super positive, right? I move out to Portland, all of that ends. And the only time my parents are hearing anything is if it's coming from me.  I then get yelled at for telling them anything. And then if they call and have this conversation, it's kind of like, \"I'm a professional coach. I know what I'm doing.\" And I think one thing about this the whole situation as well as my dad is a doctor,  but if you meet any good doctor, right? If something's not their area of expertise, they're always gonna be like, \"No, go to somebody who is an OB-GYN, is an orthopedist, et cetera, et cetera.\"  And I think there kind of was this feeling of like, \"This is a Nike. This is a team that has a multi-million dollar budget. Is paying people high amounts of money.  Is kind of presenting themselves as this incredibly professional organization, one of a kind situation.\" And if they're being told that I'm working with somebody for my mental health,  and and nutrition, and all that sort of stuff, they're gonna assume that true. Right, and that it's gonna be somebody who's really good, right? Exactly, yeah. But this guy, this sports psychologist, Darren Treasure, that was his name.  I read, I think this was in Chris Chavez's side piece, that anything that any of the athletes shared with that guy just ended up back with Alberto,  like it was this this kind of expectation of privacy that in fact was not private at all, it at all funneled back to Salazar, again, him being a puppeteer,  and controlling the flow of information between everybody. Yes and I came up in a household where there was a doctor, and somebody who really prided themselves on being a good doctor, and being somebody who never overstepped the rules  or things like patient client privilege is incredibly important. And so, when you almost are exposed to that at a young age, and then you're told somebody is a sports psychologist, I know what that means, and all the other athletes know what that mean.  And so, if they're telling something personal or private, they're going to assume that it's not gonna be told to somebody else, let alone their competitor teammate,  or their coach who maybe they're talking about. And over time, I really, I think the thing I regret the most is that there were moments where I realized what was happening  in that another athlete would be discussed with me who I knew he worked with, and in a way that was incredibly negative, but rather than take that moment and stepping back and saying, \"Hey, this is inappropriate.  He's hypothetically breaking laws if he's truly a sports psychologist, what is he doing to me?\" Instead in those moments, I was just like, \"I'm glad he's not talking about me, or my weight, or saying something mean about me.\" Yeah, I think the thing that people don't get,  or might miss in trying to understand that this dynamic is that when you're an athlete at the highest level, and you're on this elite team, there's a couple of things at play. One of which is everybody's trying to covet favor with the coach,  everybody wants to be the favorite. You hear, Kara Goucher has spoken about this with Alberta, and when you're in that catbird seat and you are the favorite, it doesn't matter what the coach is saying about the other athletes because you're gonna protect that.  And just because you're all on the same team, there isn't the esprit de corps that you would suspect because everybody's vying for a limited number of Olympic slots, these may be your teammates and you're training with them every day, and on some level, some surface level,  you're mutually supportive, but ultimately they're your competitors also. So there's a cutthroat aspect of this. So it's working at cross purposes with the kind of unity that you would want with the people you're showing up to train with every day. Yeah, absolutely.  And I think that's why personally I've never named other athletes. Even in stories that I've told in which I'm referring to another teammate of mine doing something negative, or being in the room or et cetera,  I don't name them because personally although I've never, minus a couple of individuals, I've never gotten really like a, \"Hey, I heard you,\" I'm sorry, moment, I don't need that from them.  And even though I think their behavior was bad, and poor, and the inability for people to stand up after the fact and say like, \"Yes, that was wrong,\" is something that I'm always gonna wonder,  it takes a lot of bravery to do that, and it takes a lot of vulnerability to do that, but it's my maybe ability to somewhat sympathize is the reason that I don't. I almost try to keep the athletes as out of this as I can.  Yeah, I mean, and listen, we should point out that in the wake of you sharing your story with \"The New York Times,\" so many people came out to support you, and all these people that were on your team have come out of the woodwork to say nice things about you,  and also express their regret at not having been kind of more aware or supportive in the moment. Yeah, and I think that's why it's like both Cam Levins and Dathan Ritzenhein, were my two athletes at the time,  who have since reached out to me, and publicly said they witnessed, or at least in the case of Cam, witnessed some of this behavior, is something that I always cry when I talk about that  'cause I think again, for so many years when you think it's your fault, having at least one person say they thought, that's always the thing that kills me.  And I think it's just because I know how brave it is to say I messed up, I know how brave it is to say I wish I did something different. And there are people I wish that I had saved over the years,  and so, to have somebody come out and say that really means a lot. So, I always- Especially if and when they're still part of the Nike family, there's a lot of stake, it's risky to do that and so,  yeah, that is something to be appreciated, and it's very cool. And in terms of you thinking perhaps some of these situations alluded your gaze, you're now in this incredible situation  where you can be this voice for change. And I know you've taken that mantle seriously, and we're gonna get into that. But when I think about Alexi, I see somebody who really appreciates  and understands the power of mentorship. She's always seeking out mentors, and she understands her responsibility and role as a mentor. And on some level that's part of your friendship dynamic  because she's a little bit further down the path and all of that. And now because of your relationship with Alexi and what you've gone through, I feel like you really get that as well. 100%. And I think for me as a very young athlete,  one thing that's always a little awkward, and I'm sure everybody who's ever been kind of on that, for lack of a better word phenom level, you kind of expect everybody to welcome you with open arms 'cause you're like, \"I'm 12, this is fun.  Everybody's gonna be my friend.\" And the truth is you're often met with a lot of negativity, especially within the competitive space. And I get it, if you're a 30 year old competitor,  you don't really want this 18 year old beating you. But I think kind of having felt like I was alone for so long in sport, and was able to find a friendship like Alexi's.  She was one of the first people who really took me under their wing, and shared advice, and shared stories, and who didn't just kind of look at me as purely a competitor, or purely somebody to use for pacing or whatever.  And as a result now I'm very cognizant of the younger generation, and the people who are coming up, and after a race, they're gonna be the first people I'd be aligned over to so that I can invite them to dinner, or hanging out with or, just make them feel like they were a part of the event  in a way that matters. And it's sad 'cause even to this day I haven't been to too many races, there've been a lot of injuries over the years. But the ones that I am, it's like go over to somebody, I'm like, \"Why is nobody else doing this too?\"  And I think it's because sport in so many ways has been, at least on the professional side, the number of times I'll listen to an interview and an athlete will say like, \"Well, sport is selfish,\" and I'm like, \"I think that's a cop out.  I think it's selfish if you want it to be selfish.\" If you wanna kind of not give back in some way, then you can choose not to. But if you wanna have a purpose kind of during your career, and do something during it,  there's always gonna be opportunity to. Yeah, well, I think people are wired in different ways. There are certain competitors who feel like that's the only path to greatness is if they're completely focused on themselves.  Any athlete who's excelled with longevity though, realizes that that's an unsustainable fuel source, and ultimately leads to early retirement or burnout. And the true greats at some point, even if they had that mindset earlier,  realize that when you're living, when you broaden the aperture on your life, that actually your performance gets better. I mean, Shalane talks about that quite a bit as well. Like when she's having kids and all of that and trying to juggle you think, or Kerri Walsh Jennings, right?  She's married with kids and trying to juggle that, and saying, \"Oh, it actually helps me. It makes me a better competitor.\" But I think at the same time, there's a systemic misalignment of incentives in that  the sponsorship ecosystem is set up to financially reward you for your performance, right? And this is something you're very active and upending, but it's not just, \"Hey, there's only a few slots  to make the world championship team or the Olympic team,\" it's that, \"My bank account is contingent upon me beating you, and if I get beat by you, my shoe sponsor may not renew my contract.\"  So you're living event to event and kind of in fear of trying to protect your ability to put food on the table. And so, that's gonna create a negative environment in terms of how the athletes are  interacting with each other. Absolutely. And it's going to create the win at all costs culture, and honestly predispose people to cheat. And it's because I get it.  If that's your only financial opportunity, and it's all about competition. And I think the unfortunate thing too is who gets a contract versus who doesn't?  Yes, it's all about performance, but if you look the right way, maybe we're gonna knock you a couple of extra dollars, or if we just like the way you interview, there's no real metric.  Even when you look at the disparity between different people's contracts because everything is NDA'd, and so nobody, if you're in the sports world- Yeah, there's no transparency about what they, so the athletes don't know who's getting what.  Exactly, and some people might be open and share with others, and other times it's very tight lipped. And the problem is you'll know one person's making below minimum wage to compete at really the highest level,  and somebody else is doing incredibly well. And even the incredibly well side it's just, there's not a lot of money in track and field. And I think when athletes aren't able  to really negotiate for themselves when they're not even aware of what's a good price to be negotiating, it leaves just so much agency out of the hands of the athletes.  I feel like the sponsorship approach that a lot of these brands have historically taken is really based on antiquated metrics. The idea like, \"Oh, you have to make this team and go to the,  these are the events you're gonna show up at, and if you get first, you get this, second, third,\" all of that, and that is dictating how much money you make really doesn't make sense, especially in a social media world.  What is the purpose of a company sponsoring an athlete, it's to engender goodwill in the brand, and hopefully encourage people out in the world to purchase their products. Well, how do you do that? Well, winning races is just one way,  but in an era where athletes are shouldering the responsibility of communicating directly with audiences, and developing their own trust with those people, it's not,  where are you stand on the podium no longer is really the most important thing. It's who do people like? Who do people trust? That could be somebody who's not making any of these meets or these competitions,  and somebody who no one's ever heard of that has no audience and no interest in communicating with the public in any way, and wins, I don't know, the steeple chase or something like that in some European race,  is that moving the needle in terms of the brand? So it just doesn't, it needs to be completely rethought bottom to top. And that's why I love kind of this relationship that you have with Tracksmith, you're just basically a salaried employee and they're like,  \"We love you, go do your thing, and spread the love of running, and yeah, go do some races, but where you end up in those races really is not relevant to your paycheck.\" Yeah, no, not at all, and if anything,  I think they value my performance as an employee more than an athlete. I think if I was dropping the ball, and missing all of my assignments, I think we'd have real talking to, even if I made the Olympic team tomorrow.  And I think that's incredibly important because it's a way to value athletes as more than just products. It's a way for me to develop a career skill that long-term is transferable into the open market  because as much as I love running and as much as we all love sport, everybody has a point where they're going to have to move on to their next career, and the truth is no runner is really getting set up for life  based on their salary. It's not like we're in a professional sports league where if you make it to 40, you're retiring in a really great natural spot. And as a result, there's kind of this  inability for most people in these traditional contracts to develop those career skills in a way that's as supportive as a relationship like Tracksmith that I have where my training, my dreams as an athlete  are beyond supported. And if one day I'm not dialing in until 10:30 'cause I had a little bit more of an important workout in the morning, so as a result I'm gonna be sending some emails at 7:00 p.m. that's totally understood.  And that's encouraged, that's accepted, and it's not something that I almost have to combine two incompatible worlds. And I think a lot of other athletes who've had to kind of dive into the workforce  while sustaining their careers for that financial support, it can be harder if you're just in a traditional company that maybe doesn't understand why you have to travel X amount of times to go to meets, and kind of random parts of the country where they're like- Yeah, and it's expensive.  Yeah, but if you look at other different kinds of sports and certain legacy brands like in the climbing world, in the mountaineering world, you look at Salomon, North Face, and athletes like Rebecca Rusch, and Hilaree Nelson,  Conrad Anker, Alex Honnold, Ricky Gates, Kilian Jornet, these brands are on board with these athletes for their life, it's like, \"Go be awesome. Just go out and do cool stuff, and we're here to support you.\"  And people love those brands as a result, it just seems better. Obviously, look Kilian and Ricky, they do interesting different types of things in running, it's not track and field where there's a stopwatch, and it's really about metrics. But I think there's something to be learned  from those brands who have been doing it for a very long time. And now other sports are trying to catch up to that. I mean, surfing, it's the same thing with surfers and all the kind of surf brands. Absolutely. And I think one thing a lot of these sports have in common is that they're all lifestyle sports  in that a lot of the kind of like traditional professional sports that we think of in the United States, at least like football, basketball, yes, you can continue doing them post collegiately, but there's this almost understanding that like,  \"You're not going to be in the NFL,\" or there's kind of this separation where like, \"I probably can't play again, unless we're doing a pickup game, or I really assembled 20 people. It's probably harder to join a league. \" It's a lot of, it almost takes a lot of scrappiness and ingenuity  to make sure you can keep playing. But sports like surfing, rock climbing, running, there's no barrier. There's no, \"Hey, I need to find six guys to play with. And even then  we need to find another six guys to play against.\" You can just lease a $80 pairs of shoes and go for a run. And I think kind of having that opportunity to really touch so many more people makes the idea of this,  the way we're kind of talking about these, umbrella them into these little big sports, really should lean more towards the how are you talking to that every day athlete? Because there's so many more of them out there.  And it's not to say that you have to talk to them, and therefore dumbed down how you're talking about running, or almost make it something where it's like you're not almost taking the running side of it seriously,  but instead you can lift all those people up with you and say like, \"Hey, I think you deserve to know how to recover like I recover. I think you deserve to know how to train like I train, and we can help you come up with ways to  build that into your life, and your schedule, and just almost create this incredibly supportive community that I think in a way a lot of the traditional professional sports kind of don't have the opportunity to tap into.  Well, it's purely based on inspiration. You have the LeBrons and people like that that are just gods that we look up to. And if they say buy this product, we're expected to buy it, right?  The difference that you're speaking to is being, yes, you're inspirational, but you didn't go to the Olympics and win five gold medals, right? You're a much more accessible human being.  And so, you're more aspirational. People aren't gonna be able to run as fast as Mary Cain, but, \"I like Mary Cain, and she's cool, and she's gonna come out and run with us, and she's going to help us along the way,\" there's a relationship aspect of it.  It's not just somebody on the billboard that if you saw them in person, you would freak out. Exactly, and I think the truth is even the athletes who win five Olympic gold medals, can still almost do that in running compared to other sports.  And it's because at the end of the day running is something that you don't need that much extra stuff to do, right? If you have a road, if you have a trail, if you have a track and,  some people don't even wear a pair of shoes, you can go out and run. And the sort of training I'm doing versus somebody else, yeah, you might not run as much, maybe the times are gonna be different, but you could still go out there and do an interval workout.  You could still go out there and run a long run, and just build it to what works for you. But whether you're the Olympic champion 20 times, or this is your first time running, you really have something in common,  and there's this ability to, I believe connect, in a way that's just really not, or really overlooked right now in an unfortunate way. Yeah, well, you're also running around New York City just everybody else, right?  Running is one of the few sports where track and field is different, but road running, trail running, the elites are running the same course at essentially the same time as everybody else. So it gives it a different vibe entirely.  And I think Tracksmith is this great kind of platform for you to do that, but I wanna talk about Atalanta. How do you say it? Atalanta. I wanna know where this word came from, but because you're really inverting the whole business model  with what you're doing with this new team. Yeah, so I think just to start off, I'll maybe explain the name which is, in sixth grade, being the nerd that I am, I took Latin. And at the very beginning of the year  we had to pick a mythological name, and that would be the name we'd be called throughout the year. And at the time I was not a runner. I had run a 5:47 mile as a sixth grader just as an afterschool gym thing. Right.  I'm not a runner. I just ran 5:47 in sixth grade. What? Yes. So I acknowledge that into much just to say- I take back all the stuff about you being relatable, but go ahead. When I went to my dad who had taken  kind of years of Latin himself and I was like, \"Oh, what should be the name I take?\" He immediately was like, \"That 5:47 let's do Atalanta.\" And the reason is it's this really beautiful Greek myth  about a woman who is a human being, they're not a goddess, but they're the fastest being in the world. And they're faster than all men, they're faster than all the gods and the goddesses.  And so much of their myth is this more feminist based myth. I mean, as much as they go. Like a \"La Strada\" kind of thing. Yes, where it's like she is a warrior, an athlete-  Right, like from the \"Wonder Woman\" Island. Exactly. What about Achilles? They just kicked him to the curb? She's faster. She's faster. And so, I always love that,  for seven years when I took Latin, that was my Latin name. And it was just one of those stories that always was kind of in the back of my head. And then recently when I was going on this endeavor to start a program  I mentioned like, \"Oh, we're coming up with names,\" and I threw that out there to one of my coworkers in New York Road Runners, and it turns out the first ever women's high-performance team in the US was based in New York City in the 1970s and that was their name. Wow. That's cool.  And I immediately was like, \"There's never really been a professional team in New York, but that is the closest thing that's come to it.\" And I'm like, \"Let's bring it back.\" Wow, I just got goosebumps. That's very cool. Thank you. And so this is set up,  this is the other interesting thing here. You've set this up as a nonprofit. So it's a nonprofit, but then, and it's got kind of two prongs as I understand it. There's going to be this elite running team of six to eight athletes,  and then there's a whole community arm that entails the outreach, and getting kids on the track and all of that. But, the professional athletes that are gonna comprise this team are gonna be paid employees of the nonprofit.  That's never been done before, that's super interesting. Yeah, so one thing that I'll immediately call out is that certain teams across the country, in Olympic movement sports are registered as non-profits.  And the reason is, is the Amateur Athlete Act of some year made it so that that was an opportunity. But we're not a non-profit in name only, we're a nonprofit and that we're actually gonna be doing service work in the community.  And in many ways I had just always seen this problem of the elite and of sport in wanting to solve it. And my relationship with Tracksmith was one in which I realized giving athletes a full time employment opportunity  where they're building career skills, taking on an actual job while still being fully supported to train, is an incredible model, and one in which I was always trying to figure out like, \"How can I grow this? How can I give more people this opportunity?\"  But I think the thing that kept kind of sticking in the back of my head is it will be great to help the professional side of sport, but how can I make this bigger? How can I help people who maybe never aspire to go on the professional end?  And to me, that was giving back to younger athletes in the local community who just maybe have been left behind in terms of programming to get them into sport, and stay at sport, and not only do it for this performance end,  but learn all of the skills around healthy sport, and keeping a positive mindset. And a lot of the things that maybe as a young girl had I learned, would have helped me maintain a more positive relationship  with sport forever when instead I kind of ended up falling through this period of time where I almost left it. Yeah. Putting that Fordham business degree to work. It's coming in handy right now, right?  My pre-med has been very much left behind. And I like how, you sent me the deck for this venture and as I'm scrolling through it, I liked how robust the part was about the community outreach,  and working with kids, and the mentor, it wasn't. There's almost a greenwashing thing with this stuff where it's like, \"Oh yeah, we're doing that. But it's not really about that because it's gonna be about these eight team members and how we're gonna crush it,\" but the feeling that I got was that  that's actually the very real part of it, and even the mindfulness that went into, the intention that went into like, \"We're not gonna go to the parks where this stuff already exists. We're gonna identify the parks where this doesn't exist, and we're going to establish that,  and it's gonna be an afterschool thing, and a Saturday morning thing. And there's gonna be always two mentors, and two athletes from the team.\" You've thought this through. Yeah, this has been a few months coming at this point.  We technically incorporated in December of 2020. And I probably started working on it sometime in November. And the reason it's taken this amount of time to fully launch and get off the ground is because I wanna do it right,  and I wanna do it in a way where it's not like I'm leaning too heavily on one side versus the other, but instead I want this to be a nonprofit that outlast my running career.  I want there to be a certain point where we've gone through three, four iterations of athletes who have all been able to move on to their next step post-career, and I am a part of that journey. And the only way you can have that  is if you set a really strong foundation. And in particular on the service side where I totally honestly have less expertise, and therefore had to lean on more people, and work with others, and set up an advisory board in which  I was getting that level of support to really make that service dream a reality, has been really, really incredible, and something that I just, I can't wait for the first program. Yeah, do you know who the elite athletes are gonna be?  Is the team already- I can't name people yet because we're- The answer is yes, but you're not gonna tell me. Exactly.

So most of these girls are- You're on a Gen Z borderline. Exactly. So most of these girls are the generation below me.  And I think this idea of giving back is something that really, really resonates with them. And the ability to actually develop career skills, and take on a true job while at the same time  having their professional running career fully supported is something that I think people are excited about because when you think of great athletes, you think of the Meghan Rapinoes of the world. And the thing is,  Megan is an incredibly talented soccer player, we love watching her on the field, but Megan means more to the world than her soccer performance. And I think as younger athletes kind of look up at that generation of greatness,  they realize that the people who they really are inspired by are those who are advocates in some way, or giving back in some way. Greatness happens off the field as much as it on.  And I think that kind of recognition is something that makes them think, \"Hey, this can be my star.\" Yeah. I think that's right, and I think that's powerful. Young people, whether it's athletes or just activists in general,  people who have a cause that they care about, and they make their lives meaningful in that regard, that's become an aspirational thing for young people, which makes me optimistic about the future. You know what I mean?  It's not enough to just go kill it and win a race. Who are you and what are you about? And how are you using that responsibility in whatever platform you've established as a result of that to actually create the world, create a better world?  Exactly, and I mean, I would say the same thing where it gives me a lot of hope 'cause of course whenever you're starting something new, and never done before, and completely unique, there's that fear of, for all of the people who I've had buy in because they've joined my board, or donated,  or coming on as sponsors, will I then turn towards the athletes and be kind of told no again and again and again. And I think to just feel the excitement in those were  going to be bringing on, and knowing that there's this understanding of being a part of something bigger, and also being a part of change. And this is something where I don't want us to be  the first and the only, I want this to become a model that's taken seriously. Heck if other organizations wanna step up and do the same thing, to me that's incredible, and that shows that I'm doing something  that can really push the sport forward. But if it just ends up having to be me starting this in different cities across the world, that's another thing too that I'll try. Yeah. No, it's super cool. I mean, I think in the wake of you  coming out and sharing your story, if you had just found a way to fall back in love with running, and maybe performed well, most people would be like, \"That's cool.\" But you've really taken this on,  shouldered this responsibility to be an example of the change that you're speaking about. You're not just talking about it, you actually are doing something. Yeah, and I think that's always been something that's been really important to me in this process.  And I feel for a while I've been just dying to tell people about this 'cause I'm really doing read something. But I think it's just kind of that cliche of, I didn't wanna just talk the talk, I wanted to walk the walk,  and I try to do that in my day to day anyway the way I talk to myself and treat myself, I try to exude this idea of healthy sport as best as I can,  and I try to give back to our local running community, but I just always felt like there was something bigger that I could be doing. And I think part of it is that New York City has never had a professional team,  and to be actually bringing one to this community that in so many ways kept me in the sport, feels like the ultimate thank you. Because it's a way for us to not just uplift  the girls that we're servicing in the local community, but also the broader running community of New York, and hopefully help create something that gets even more excitement, and drives even more people to Central Park to run with.  And just, yeah, I think it's gonna be something where there's a lot to learn and a lot to do, but I'm excited for that. How are you bankrolling this whole thing is? Is Tracksmith a partner? Or where does the funding come from? Yep, they'll be an apparel sponsor of the program,  but how we're also differentiating ourselves is it's not just a one apparel sponsor footing the bill, instead, we're kind of taking this multi revenue approach to the program.  So, where you have sponsorships such as Tracksmith, and then donations are another opportunity for us to be able to grow because we are again, a service-based nonprofit, and then lastly,  we are going to unveil a membership side to this where if you wanna get training programs, if you want to get behind the scenes kind of access to the athletes, we're trying to be much more open as an organization,  and not just use the mentorship skills that we develop to give back to the younger athletes, but to also have actual programming that if you're a member of the organization,  we're hosting weekly, biweekly events, and there's conversations with experts, and there's almost a lot of the programming that we will be doing in the parks, also being given to our members.  That's great. So when's this whole thing kickoff? June. It's happening. So very soon. Yeah, that's cool.

It's all good. No, it's good, I wanted to hear all about that. This is the best part. Back to the Nike Oregon Project and when you were running. So, you're starting to have disordered eating issues.  You end up not being able to have your period for three years or something that. Yeah, three and a half. And then you end up having five stress fractures. And that's the result of when you're not menstruating, you're starting to have all kinds of  bone density issues, right? Yeah, I had bone loss, and my numbers had started to get to a concerningly low level. And it took a lot of intervention to restrengthen them as much as I could  because between the years of 18 to 22 are your peak bone growth, and I didn't have my period between the ages of 18 and 21 and a half. Yeah, it's so pretty bad. Yeah.  It reminds me, I spoke about this with Lauren Fleshman, who I know you know, and it really speaks to, again, this systemic issue of  this kind of male dominated paradigm, where the men who are the support system and the coaches are training women fundamentally like men, and built into that is this assumption that  that women's bodies adapt and change in the same way that dudes do, and it's just not the case. The way that the female body sort of matures over time is extremely different. You were talking about, yeah, when you're a girl,  and you're starting to put on a little bit of weight, that's normal. But that hammer to just always keep your weight down, always keep your weight down, leading people into this situation of disordered eating.  I mean, it's really a big problem. Yeah, and I think a big thing I always like to start off saying is that whenever I say women's training needs to be different than men, we can train as hard as guys, if anything, I think the women can train harder.  Some of the workouts I've seen people do, we can grind. But there are certain things that are different and need to be accounted for. Even just the fact that over the course of a four week period of time there are so many studies about,  if you're in your PMS week, bluntly you're probably not gonna be performing quite as well and that doesn't mean you shouldn't push through, and sometimes kind of continued to grind, but there should be this acknowledgement that,  okay, maybe the sort of times we're targeting this week can be a little adjusted. Or if you're in a program that build for three weeks and drops for a week, maybe if we try to align that with that week, that'd be more beneficial.  So super kind of sciencey oriented opportunities are something that very, very few people talk about. But the other thing is that for women, how we're built physically and how we develop,  guys it's just an upward trajectory perpetually- Yeah, it's pretty straight forward. Girls, there's always that kind of college year slump, and that's okay, that's just a thing, and maybe one girl doesn't experience that,  maybe one girl hits it really, really hard, but if you're lifted through that and you're supported through that, then you're gonna get to 22, and then you're gonna have that kind of like resurgence of,  kind of like knowing your body, and your body kind of being in this space where it's done- Yeah, well, there's a later peak to it, right? And understanding that there's gonna be peaks and valleys through those interim years,  and not making a big to-do about that, or having it be a referendum on how the rest of your career is gonna play out I think is really important. And I think that change only happens when you are staffing these teams with women coaches  and women psycho, it's like you gotta have people who understand this, who can help these young women through this process, and not hold them to expectations that are ultimately not in their long-term best interests as an athlete.  Exactly 'cause I think one thing too is that, all of the issues that I've spoken about, REDS, Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport, which is essentially when you're under fueling, and or over-training,  and, or therefore developing different physical reactions such as bone loss, men can experience that as well. But the bar at which you start to break down  is easier for women to hit, and it's because physically we're supposed to carry a little bit more fat, where we have this almost, our fail safe of reproductive health  is gonna drop before a man's does. And as a result, we almost, it's not that we can't push ourselves as hard, but going over the red line too often is more risky. There's more opportunities for things to start to break down  just 'cause biologically we're different. And I think that's why having people who understand, and can relate, and sympathize, and have their own experiences such as other female coaches  or support staff is always going to be helpful. But it's also incredibly important so that the men who are also in those positions, and also want to be coaching or support staff, do the work, and put in the time, and educate themselves and,  I think that's can be said about so many different things. Just as we need more women in sport, we need more diverse individuals getting these positions.  And I always say that any culture that supports inclusivity, and supports diversity, and supports this ability to have different opinions in a room, and different experiences in a room and backgrounds, is always going to be a better culture  than one in which it's just one type of person. So for as much as we need more women, we also need more people of all sorts of backgrounds being able to be in those positions because  that just the ability to find ways to relate with one another, and it's just super powerful. Yeah, there's always gonna be the cult of personality with certain coaches though.  It kind of feels like that's the way it is. Maybe that can change, I don't know. I think when we're talking about this, we're talking about biology and physiology, but there's also the psychology of all of it, right? Absolutely.  On the one hand, we should point out that weight is a factor in performance in running and in lots of sports. So it's not about, \"Hey, we can't talk about that,\" or, \"That's a verboten subject,\"  but maybe don't make your athletes weigh themselves in front of the other athletes. There's a way of doing this, right? So, how do you have a productive, if you're a coach or you're an athlete,  how do you talk about this in a meaningful, productive way? Well, I think the first thing is that you have to do get yourself educated. And whether it's things like SafeSport training, or working with a nutritionist yourself or having,  and also, I'm gonna actually backtrack, registered dietician, especially if you're with younger athletes, I really recommend working with somebody who's done the full training  that's required to have a dietician's degree. I think nutritionism is like kind of this buzz word, but the truth is the more you're working with true experts and people who have devoted their life to understanding this,  the better equipped your going to be because most coaches aren't registered dieticians, and most coaches maybe have not had that level of education on this topic. So the more you're leaning on people who have  is super important. And I think another thing is, as a coach, you also have to work with somebody like a therapist or a psychologist to also make sure you're not bringing any of your  kind of own perspectives onto the track. And I think that's really important because a lot of these issues we're talking about are being talked about really loudly right now. But if you were maybe an athlete in the 90s,  and you yourself kind of went through these experiences even if you know they were wrong, I think so often people kind of bring their own history, and their own maybe discomfort with food into things.  So I think that kind of first step is take care of yourself, get the education that you can, work with the professionals that you can, and see if you can also kind of find out where your own biases lie, that's number one.  And then number two is really encourage your athletes to similarly work with those people. And once you've maybe assembled that team, or have a list of resources, try to find ways to build that into your programming,  and really make sure that the language around food, and the language around weight, and body inclusivity is always as positive as you can. And if you're not the professional, do not pretend to be that.  So if you are concerned about an athletes weight being too heavy, for example, that's not really your place to  give them a weight that they need to hit because there is no ideal weight, you don't know, the registered dietician would look at you like, \"That's not a thing. You can't give somebody an arbitrary number.\" And so I think the more you kind of try to stay in your lane,  try to direct people to the resources that truly are going to help them while at the same time educating yourself as much as possible is important. Right, and if you're a coach maybe don't bully or athletes, and talk shit about the other athletes  in front of the other athletes, and create some crazy culture of fear so that Mary Cain has to go steal cliff bars and nibble on them in the dark. Thank you Nathan. You could be caught, right? So, look, this whole thing plays,  I mean, basically in pretty short shrift after you end up in Oregon, it's not working out, right? How long were you there before you're like, \"I'm outta here and I'm done with all this.\" So I think the big thing to say is that  I left Portland by the end of my freshman year. So I was out there for about a year. But, and this is where I always kick myself looking back, that wasn't some big, \"Oh, this was bad, I'm leaving,\" moment.  This was more me apologizing to everybody because- You couldn't live up to Alberto's standards. Yes. You couldn't cut it. Exactly. So I moved home to New York and I told everybody like, \"I have disordered eating.  I have been trying to make myself throw up, and I can't do this, this is super unhealthy. I'm cutting myself, my mental health is fully deteriorating. I'm really sorry, but I just need to figure this out and then I'll come back.\"  So that was the plan. Just to back up for a second. When you, cause you told, did you tell Alberto, or one of the coaches that you were cutting yourself, right? And what was the response? It was after this race that had been delayed.  And so, it was late at night, and I was truthfully having a full breakdown. And I was really scared that I was gonna hurt myself. And so, I went to Alberto and the sports psychs room,  and I told them like, \"I just tried to make myself throw up multiple times the bathroom. I've been cutting myself,\" at this point the sports had already caught me doing it a couple of times, so he knew that I was.  And I was like, \"I don't know what to do. I really need help.\" And this is the other thing that always makes me cry. I was told that they wanted to go to sleep because it was late.  And that crushed me in a way that I don't know what I thought they were gonna do, but I think I just thought they would do something.  And so, the next day I called my mom, who I at that point, I hadn't been talking to honestly and openly. And I told her I have a really bad relationship with food now.  And I didn't tell her that I was cutting myself at the time, I was too embarrassed. And so, my mom and dad at that point had been not spoken to by the coaches for awhile.  There'd been too many moments of red flags, and me saying something and then getting in trouble, and then part of being scattered across the country. And so, they booked a flight home. The next day I got on a plane to New York,  and the plan was I'm going to get myself back together so that I'm tough enough to rejoin the team fully. So I spent a year in New York during which- So that was always the plan to go back. And let's just pause for a moment.  I mean, I'm so sorry that that happened to you and, it's infuriating that you would go to, was it the psychologist person? And literally say like,  \"This is what I'm doing and I need help.\" And that person says, \"I'm tired, I need to go to bed.\" I mean, it's just unbelievable. Yeah, and I mean, he had caught me doing it a couple of times, and both times it was just kind of knock it off, and waved off and-  That's helpful. He'd seen me self-harm myself in other ways as well. There was a track workout in which, and a lot of people witnessed this, unfortunately, but I started hitting myself,  and I, so sad, but I was racing 400. And if you've ever been to Nike's track there's trees in the middle. So I ran a 200, and I ran off the track,  and I ran towards where the bridle is. And I don't know what was in my head, I think I just wanted to get off campus, and run into traffic honestly. And the sports tech ran after me, I was hitting myself,  and they dragged me back onto the track, and I had to finish the workout. And in those moments, I think what people don't always recognize is that to me even saying this now, I'm so embarrassed that I did that.  To me, even though I know everything that had happened, that feels very unprofessional. So when I'm being told at 18 that you're being super unprofessional, knock it off, get on the track, finish it.  You're already in a really bad place. So you're not thinking, \"Hey, why aren't you helping me? This is clearly a sign of distress.\" Instead I'm thinking, \"Yeah, I agree with you. This is super unprofessional. I'm really sorry. I'm sorry, I'm disrupting the workout.  Is everybody else okay? Okay, I'm gonna cry myself around the track now for the next four laps.\" And I say that not to really do anything more than,  for anybody right now who's had that sort of experience where they relate to the fact that something wasn't done for them, but rather than kind of recognize it as wrong  in that moment and it maybe even right now, they were still saying, sorry, don't say, sorry. In those moments, the right thing to do would have been get me help. In those moments the right thing that anybody should have done  was shut that down and intervene. Right. And if anybody should have had the wherewithal to do that, it's the Nike Oregon Project, the most well-funded elite track and field situation perhaps in the world.  It would be one thing if it was some high school track coach that didn't know any better, and he's like, \"All right, well,\" maybe that guy just is not trained to know what to do in that situation, but it's really inexcusable  that that went down the way that it did. Yeah, and I mean, to this day, I have no idea if any of those individuals are SafeSport certified. And if they are, they're, I mean, I am,  and there are multiple modules where you can't watch that and not be like, \"Well, we've broken 40 of these rules for so many different times?\" Yeah, well, I think there's a lot of education that needs to be done around that.  And also the scope of what SafeSport is about because I think there's this sense that it's about sexual abuse or doping only, and that's kind of the limits.  I think people need to better understand that it does expand to all of these kinds of mental health situations. Yeah, and it's not at all about doping, it's all about really like a coach's guidebook to abuse, and what not to do.  And I think they really incredible thing about their programming is the fact that it's real, I mean, it's really well done, and it's done by professionals, and I recommend every single individual that works with any sort of athlete,  whether you're a parent, whether you're an athlete yourself, a coach, an AD, get yourself SafeSport certified, even if it's not required of you. And the reason is there are so many different things that I even look back on my experience and I'm like,  \"God, that was part of the toxicity.\" If you're working with a 16 or 17 year old, they probably shouldn't stay in your house when they're traveling.  You probably shouldn't be texting each other every day. And all of those sort of barriers that create this sense of almost connection,  or this family bond, if you will, are really not positive things because this is a child,  and you shouldn't be overstepping like that. And so when things start to go wrong, that kid's first thought is gonna be like, \"This person is like my uncle. I can't let them down.\" Yeah, well, it's more than that.  This is the person who's going to help me realize my dream. And this is the person who believes in me, and who is telling me that I'm capable of these things. It's unbelievably intoxicating. Yes. But what the point that I'm trying to make is  I understand well how potent and powerful that dynamic is. And when you're a young person and you're impressionable, you don't want your parents, your parents, what they have to say is irrelevant. You're protecting this very, you feel very special.  You are the person who is touched, and you are going places, and everybody else, \"Get out of the way, and I'm gonna listen to what this coach says.\" And you have no ability to gauge the unhealthy nature of it  because you don't know any different. No, and you're looking at your teammates, and whenever you ask them for help, they're saying like, \"Buy in, stop complaining, do what you're told. He's the best coach. He's gonna get you to the top.\" I think an elephant in the room  that maybe it needs to be addressed with all of this is that my old coach, Alberto, isn't just banned by SafeSport, he's also banned by USADA. And so, in retrospect there's always that part of me that's like,  \"I kept saying no to thyroid medication. I kept saying no to using an inhaler. I didn't use birth control for weight loss reasons because I knew at that point there were deeper problems going on and that was not-\"  The birth control was his means of addressing the period thing, right? No. No? I misread that then. So he has since said that, but the reason I was put or I didn't actually take it,  so I wasn't, I was given physician samples birth control from his own doctor who was friends with him, is because he felt that I was bloating a lot.  And he felt some of my weight might be because this is just gonna all sound crazy because I was really still cycling and maybe still PMSing, but just not bleeding. Sorry for that,  I should've given a content warning for that. And as a result, he thought some of my weight was because I was super bloated, and we needed to de bloat me. And so, that's why diuretics had been thrown out, diuretics are not allowed, I said, no.  And then birth control became this thing that he decided would really help me lose the weight, which doesn't make any sense, it isn't a thing. But I was brought into the doctor. She gave me birth control  because he wanted me to lose weight. And the thing is, if I went in there and I said, \"Hi, I'm an 18 year old girl, I want birth control for birth control purposes,\" they can give you,  they can kind of just give them to you, right? But if I go in- Like samples. Yes. But if I go into the doctor's office with my coach, who I'm not related to, and they sit through the whole appointment and talk about how I need to lose weight, ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "What excites women in the recruitment process?", "Question 2": "How do women aim to give back?", "Question 3": "What career skills do younger athletes develop?", "Question 4": "Who do young athletes find inspiration from?", "Question 5": "What can create optimism about the future?", "Question 6": "What funding model is used for the program?", "Question 7": "When will the program officially start?", "Question 8": "What issues are associated with female athletes' training?", "Question 9": "How should coaches approach athletes' health discussions?", "Question 10": "What is the importance of safe sport certification?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "The ability to give back and develop mentorship skills, go through appropriate training, and have their professional running career fully supported.", "Answer 2": "Women aim to give back by developing mentorship skills, going through appropriate training to perform service work, and being part of something bigger that creates change in their communities.

That's insane. That's crazy. What other kind of doping stuff did you see, or that was omposed upon you?  I think the thing is, and I always come back to this is, I was just the person who always said no. And it wasn't from anything other than the fact that, again, I think I took so much of this like,  \"Oh no, they probably don't even know diuretics aren't allowed. Let me explain to them that I'm not gonna take them because make sure you never encourage somebody else to do it kind of way.\" The 17, 18 year old is gonna explain it to the- Exactly.  And I think a big thing was, really early on, I was always, everything had to be triple checked with the Global DRO, which is how you know something's banned. So I would eat Tums and be panicky trying to figure out if Tums were bad, right?  So, that was a big thing when I was in high school. And then as soon as I went out there, it kind of became more like, \"No, you're good.\" And it was kinda more like, \"Hey, I know your dad had said thyroid might be bad before,  but your numbers are kind of on the lower end. They're not low, but maybe we should do this.\" And I'd be like, \"No, my dad has said you're not supposed to take that if you don't need it.\" Or it would be like,  \"Hey, you're always breathing really heavy while running. Maybe you have asthma, maybe you need an inhaler.\" Right, always trying to find the medical exemption so that you could get the-. Yes, and I was given an inhaler at some point. I never took it 'cause I remember again, being so like,  \"Guys, I think you're making a mistake,\" and again- And are you getting the periodic knock on the door and doing the, getting drug tested? Yeah, I was drug tested a ton. And I always joke,  I was in that big Fancy Bear's leak, my information was threatened to be leaked, but on it it said two Flintstone Vitamins, and two iron tablets, and vitamin D, and so, they never released it.  And I felt so both vindicated, but also kind of put out that I'm on food still vitamins, like, \"Watch them cower,\" as I walk out to the track. But the thing is I was always saying no,  and it was always coming back to weight of like, \"Well, you need this because thyroid can make you skinnier too, and birth control for weight loss.\" And I think that's just important to say  because sometimes it also just makes me be when the other athletes were like, \"Just buy in already,\" was that something else? And the answer is, I don't know.  And sometimes I wish I could go back and have been more conscious in those moments of what was really going on but- Was there pressure from the other athletes to get on board with some kind of protocol?  Well, we did have a team bonding trip and during it, one of the athletes did tell me that I needed to step up and stop being such a baby. And kind of either you got to buy in or you're not on the team sort of talk.  And it was funny 'cause it was this team bonding trip. And I was the first person to talk, and I was like, \"This was so much fun, we made memories and friendship, and I'm 12.\" And then the next person to go was like,  \"You have to step it up. You either have to be professional, or off this team\" kind of talk, and I was like, \"Well, the friendships are over.\" So I think it's just,  I'm only saying this because I think in so many ways, the reason that this system of current sponsorship is troubling is because all lines become blurred.  Because if everything is about performance, right? Well, things like weight is gonna be overstepped. But how much of the weight overstepping was because there was maybe a want for cheating the habit? I don't know.  And so, when everything is about performance, then kind of however you get there, people act like it's okay. And if it means burning some people out, if it means stepping all over people,  if it means treating people poorly, it's not personal, it's business was always the catch phrase that I used to hear. And I'm like businesses that operate like this aren't good.  And usually ultimately that comes to light, and there has to be a reckoning. And I think society should never condone that sort of behavior for the sake of performance because there are plenty of people who are performing incredibly and who don't do that.  Well, this did all come out. I mean, all of this was going on for you in 2015, right? Yeah, so 2015, 2016, I was still on the team. What ultimately happened was that again, I had kind of wanted just,  I stayed on the team, and I wanted to ultimately be back on the team in this full way. But as I had mentioned earlier, I had never told my parents about the cutting. They only knew that I was struggling with food. And after the Olympic trials,  my current coach, John Henwood, caught me cutting myself. He immediately called my parents, and was like, \"I'm really sorry.  She asked me not to call you, but I'm really scared for her. And I don't know what to do. I don't know what I'm supposed to do in this situation, but I'm here with her. I need help.\"  He did what you're supposed to do. He did what a grownup would do. And I was so mad at him. And he admitted that he didn't know. And he admitted that he didn't know how to handle it. And I was so mad at him for years afterwards. And I have always loved John.  It wasn't like that, but to me it was like this horrible moment because one, I was super embarrassed, and now my parents know, and that's embarrassing.  And two, my parents were like, \"You have to leave this team. This is destroying you. This is tearing you apart. You have to leave.\" And I think there was a period of time where my parents could not understand  why I so couldn't see that the system was a problem. And I think part of it was they didn't know a lot of these stories, these stories that I'm telling now.  I sat my parents down before \"The New York Times\" piece came out, and I just told them everything. And so, there's so many more moments that I've never talked about, and aren't even public that they almost saw what was happening to me,  but they didn't even know how it was happening. But, they told me like, \"This is a bad set up for you. You have to have health being your number one.\" And so, I left the team and then the sad irony is that  that's when my body was finally like, \"You've been doing damage for so many years.\" My bone density was lowered substantially, and then I started to break. And it was this kind of tragic, yes, I had the left,  but I think because I didn't actually let go, and I didn't actually understand what was wrong with the situation that it just I was in this cycle.  And the truth is what snapped me out of it was when the USADA report came out in which Alberto was banned, my first, my immediate reaction was like, \"No way, he didn't do anything,\"  that was literally my first reaction to it. And I the next day read the whole entire report, it's 270 pages. I read it word for word. And holy crap,  it was the first time I saw on paper that they lied. And there's so many moments in it where it'll say something like, \"Athletes on the team were told that  USADA I had given them permission to do blank,\" right? And I had been told that, I thought that was true, of course, yes. This giant company that's telling me that, \"We got full approvals, don't worry about it, all these allegations are lies.\"  You're kind of like, \"I don't know, they're worth billions of dollars, I think they're telling the truth.\" What's your sense of how high up that went at Nike? Very.  The CEO stepped down. That high? I mean, he was in on the emails. And again, some of this stuff happened before I was on the team, actually almost all of it did. Yeah, and all these people have come out going back to 2008, right?  Telling stories about this. Yeah. And so, I was always, there was no, I almost was never there firsthand. I was only ever hearing things second hand because I joined the team in 20, well, I started working with Alberto in 2012.  Seriously actually joined the team in 2013, and it was around then that allegation started to pop up, right? So I'm already in the bubble, I'm already in the system. And when you're being told like, \"No, that was misconstrued.  All 10 of us are saying, this was actually what happened, you weren't there but here's some story,\" you're kind of like, \"I trust these people. They're my friends. They wouldn't do me wrong.\"  And so, as I was reading the USADA report, there were all of these moments of me being like, \"Oh my God, USADA is telling me that I was lied to. And I'm one of the athletes that they're sub-tweeting this thing of saying that they thought this was the thing,\"  and I was just frozen. And even now trying to describe the feeling it's like I had just so many emotions run through me  because that was when the flood opened for me internally, and I suddenly was like, \"Whoa, if everything in this was a lie, then what else was happening  that I've never let myself come to terms with?\" And the thing is had you talked to me the day before the USADA report came out, and you looked me in the eye and you said, \"I know everything you went through, you were emotionally abused,\" put a laugh at your face, I would've walked away I mean like,  What is that guy talking about?\" But as soon as I knew, I could look back on my experience and I could see the lies,  and I could see the abuse for what it was, that was the most, both empowering and terrifying moment. Right, it shatters the illusion. Complete shattering.  And, again, I think really the scary thing about abuse is that the reason it takes years for people to come out  is because so often they don't even know that's what it was. And for me, it was like as soon as I knew that was what had happened, my first thought was,  \"Holy crap. There's other people who don't know.\" And that's scary. It also explains why you wanted back on the team, right? Which is part and parcel of Nike's big defense in all of this like, \"What do you mean she's saying all this stuff? She was trying to get back on the team. I'm like, \"Yeah, of course.\" We didn't know about any,  so, right. So, well, Salazor gets banned in September of 2019, right? So does that report come out in advance of that, or did those things, they came out at the same time. It was like they happened same moment, and then six weeks later, \"The New York Times\" piece came out.  They were the longest six weeks in my life. So, there's a good three year period where you go from being Mary Cain, fastest girl in America, bright future,  Olympic glory is a foregone conclusion for this person. There was even a \"New York Times\" article about you in 2015, right? And painted this- Which was a whole thing. Glorious picture, you're whitewashing this whole experience. But then there's this period where you disappear, right?  It's like, \"What happened to Mary Cain? She just vanished off the landscape.\" You go home, you're trying to piece yourself back together during this period of time. It's this fallow era where suddenly you're nowhere to be found, then...  So you're dealing with what you're dealing with and trying to come to terms with this, but still buying into all of it, thinking you're gonna make your way back, right? Until this report comes out. And I'll say this, right?  So I was like, \"I'm not tough enough. I can't handle it. I'm maybe not built to be a pro,\" right? And what ended up happening was I kind of had this injury,  and again, my parents, my coach, John, nobody, I hadn't really shared a lot of these stories with. There was maybe inklings of it and pieces of it, but with everything you're just,  if I can't even look back on that, how could I share that with somebody else? And so, around probably the beginning of that year, it was maybe 2018 summer, Alberto and I had talked once,  and it was kind of meant for me to be my closure moment of being okay, and- And you're still getting paid by Nike though throughout this period? Yeah, I was still, yeah, my contract ended December 31st, 2018.  So I was still a Nike athlete. So it wasn't weird in a way that there was that kind of moment. And then kind of between then and when I was gonna be hurt at the beginning of 2019, he kind of kept reaching out to my coach  just to see how am I doing? Friendly stuff, I think, okay we're fine, right? And then I got hurt. We asked like, \"Oh, any tips?\" I ended up going out to Portland.  And for me, a lot of it was, again, I still had this, I felt so bad about everything that had happened. And I talked very openly with Alberto about the fact that  I developed a really serious disordered eating. And I use the word disorder eating instead of eating disorder because I wasn't bulimic, and I wasn't anorexic, in terms of true clinically diagnosed.  Right, the clinical definitions for those. But I under ate substantially and I was underweight a lot, and I went through big fluctuations, and I would try to purge and I wouldn't be successful.  So it's kind of more within that disordered eating bucket. But I shared this and it was kind of like, \"Okay.\" I just had not acknowledged,  and I think that was kind of like a little bit like, wow, I guess that's, to me and I think at the time it was almost just like, \"Yeah, you weren't, you couldn't handle it.\"  And I think that was kind of like- So in his, in other words, sorry to interrupt you. In other words, in his mind, you being a product and not a person, he'd already made the decision that you were damaged goods. Yeah, 100%. And he's like, \"Oh, that's fine, you can come and tell me that.  But like I already knew this wasn't gonna work out and I've moved on.\" Totally, and so, you're kind of like, \"Okay, cool.\" But I'm still trying to try and be a pro or whatever. But I'm at that point, pretty okay.  Maybe start that first crack in the rose-colored glasses is hit, right? And up until that nobody had ever hit the glasses, right? I've just been going through life, being that whole situation was totally normal because everybody who was out there with me  acted like it was totally okay. And I'm too embarrassed to tell almost people in my life who maybe would tell me that it wasn't. So the first cracks hit and I'm still fine.  And then just going through life. So that once boom, the USADA report comes out. I think it was almost this like, \"Oh,\" not only do I kind of have this moment- Like you just got, you got red pill, right?  Like you just went into the matrix all of a sudden, or came out of the matrix. And who knows, maybe had I not had that little crack in the glasses, maybe they wouldn't have fully shattered, I have no idea. I think they would have 'cause  if you read 270 pages of that report you're just mind blown, recommend it, fun times. But I think that when I came out and I shared my story, right?  I think first off I thought nobody was gonna read it. And I'm like my mom's gonna get me a pity watch, and feel sad that she watched that thing, and then there's gonna be a small contingency of the running community.  And I honestly thought that 50% of the people, again, maybe 10 people watch it. Five of those people are like, \"That's that.\" One person is like, \"Wow, that's me,\" and then the other four are like,  \"That girl's fat. She was just slow.\" But to me, that one person saying, \"Okay, wow, that is me,\" would be worth it. And I didn't care how many people were negative,  I didn't care at all about the response, it was just for that one person. And it was a Thursday morning I woke up, and it was everywhere and I was- 17 Million people have watched on YouTube alone.  And Lord knows how many on \"The New York Times\" website, it's insane. But I wanna back into this a little bit because there's a lot more going on here. After the report comes out,  the rose-colored glasses are cracking a little bit. You're coming to terms with the reality of this situation. And on some level, you're wrestling with the idea of going public with it.  But the initial thought was, \"I'll share this on Instagram. I'll write a little thing up,\" then bringing it back to how we started this podcast, enter Alexi Pappas, who I didn't know  was the puppet master behind the scenes here that put you with Lindsay Crouse, and kind of set in motion this whole thing. Yeah, and what it was like, when I even first spoke to Alexi,  it was in that like very just, \"I need to write. I need to throw stuff onto paper, almost throw this bad analogy,\" but it's all because- But that's pretty fast from a crack in the glasses  to like, \"I feel the need to talk about this now.\" Yes, and I think it's because they're such a frantic energy, and this almost fear that happens in that moment.  Because I'm gonna say that this whole situation has made me, and this is bad, this is something I'm working on with my therapist, but less trusting.  And it's made me more skeptical of authority. And it's made me question society's behavior in a way that I just never had done before. And I think that's really powerful,  and I think that's a great thing. But in that moment it's really horrifying to be like, \"Oh my God, this was condoned. This was normalized. People acted this was okay.  And I'm realizing right now how bad this was. And who am I kind of in this big world to have figured it out?\" And I think knowing that I did,  it was like 24 hours ago, I didn't. And that person almost scared me. And I was like, \"I need to help them.\" And obviously I couldn't go back in time and help myself,  so how can I pass it forward to the next person? It was my immediate reaction. And I remember I pulled my parents aside, maybe the next day, or really early on in this, and I was like, \"I have to tell you everything.\"  And we did the deep dive and we went, this was like an hour as long conversation of me just sharing everything. And as soon, there's obviously a lot of tears. I can't even get through a podcast without crying.  And at the end, my parents' question was like, \"What are you gonna do?\" And I said, and I don't know why, I think I'm gonna start crying, but I was like, \"I don't think I'm ever going to be a pro runner again,  but I love the sport. Nobody's ever gonna sign me. Nobody's ever gonna follow me again.\" I said, \"But I can't live with myself if I don't share this,  and if I don't help that one person.\" And I remember they were so scared for me, and so proud of me at the same time.  And I think for them it was just like, it was almost like this happy proud, and this like, \"You're doing something bigger than yourself.\"  And again, we didn't think anybody would watch the video. I thought if anything, and I'm gonna be very honest when I say this, having so many people watch that protected me  in a way that I don't know do people understand. And had that been something where a couple thousand people watched it,  the same negativity from one side of that conversation would have been louder, and it probably would have been stronger. And you see it in how other athletes from that program have since been treated when they left,  and when they came forward and when they were vocal, and in many ways that's what I thought I was going to experience. I mean, Kara Goucher has gotten death threats.  Athletes have been called horrible things across website, social media, they've been gaslighted. And I was prepared for that, that was what I was signing up for. And the sport is one in which again,  what was done was really horrible, and yet, a lot of the competitors of these organizations don't necessarily turn around and say like, \"Oh, wow, you're really trying to do something good in the world.  Let's support you.\" If anything in the traditional space, it's much more like, \"No, you're not that fast anymore. Whatever.\" Yeah, and everybody's running to protect their own at the same time. I mean, it is a David and Goliath story.  It's not just, \"Hey, this is Mary Cain, and she's gonna share her story of how hard it was.\" This is you basically taking on Nike. I mean, that's a very,  and you're a young person, that's very scary, and you still wanna have this career in running. So you're gonna become, you're risking becoming persona non grata in doing this. And that takes an unbelievable amount of courage to do that.  And I thank you for saying that. And I think again though the almost sad thing is that yes, it was courageous, and yes, I was being vulnerable, but that was pure fear that was guiding me. And it wasn't fear of repercussions,  it wasn't fear of the big, bad guy, it was fear that somebody was living a lie, and hurting themselves because they didn't know it. And it was fear for that younger version of myself.  It was that fear of that version of myself from 72 hours before that drove me. And I say that in so much as to say I think these issues are terrifying.  I think the fact that we don't support and protect people, and treat them as these incredible gifts, and I say this in a very general way outside of sport way,  people are people they're not products. And when organizations lose sight of that and take advantage of people, that goes beyond sport. Women being taken advantage of goes beyond sport.  Women being objectified, this is like, the reason 17 million people watched it is because it's not just a sport story, and it's not even just a woman's story. This is when powerful people abuse.  And what is power? It depends on the situation. And so, there are plenty of people in the world with power over others. And the idea that somebody was trapped in that was,  that fear guided me. And so, when people say I was brave or courageous, I thank them, I appreciate that, but this wasn't a moment for me.  This was literally me chucking the baton across the room, and being like, \"Save yourself\" because it's horrifying when you're in that. And I couldn't get proper treatment really until I knew.  My relationship with food pre, even during that \"New York Times\" piece was weaker now than it is today. And it's because all the work that I had done  had always been not at the root of the issue. Well, that earnestness and that sensibility comes across in the video for sure. I mean, you get that. And I think that's a big reason why  it did end up connecting with so many people. And for people that haven't seen it, essentially, Lindsay Crouse, who's been on the podcast before, accomplished runner in her own right, is all about these issues.  She's like the perfect person for Alexi to say, \"Go see this person.\" I know you contacted her and she's like, \"Come to the 'New York Times' office right now do the meeting\" And you're like, \"I thought I was gonna do an Instagram post,\"  and now you're making this movie with her. But she really helps craft and shepherd this message in a mindful, intentional way. And the end product of which is, is really palpable and powerful. So, it's not surprising to me  that so many people have not only seen it, but were impacted by it. And all of this happens really quickly, right? So the USADA Salazar thing comes out in September, right?  I will write down the timeline here 'cause it all happens really quickly. October, Nike shuts down Oregon Project. November, well then, so the Nike CEO, Mark Parker steps down.  Was that before the video? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, and then November 4th, WADA says it will investigate each athlete that trained with Salazar. By the way, I was never investigated, and I was one- You weren't? I was gonna ask you I was like, \"What's the status of that by the way?\"  I was about to say, \"Please investigate me. I don't know what camera I have to look at. Yeah, what's going on. Because to me- (sighs) The story seems to end with your video kind of- It's so frustrating. And your call for third-party investigation of Nike. I couldn't find any evidence that,  there's a narrative beyond that, it doesn't seem that that's happening. But in any event, so November 7th then your video comes out, and it explodes. Yeah, and then Alberta was SafeSports banned, maybe a few weeks after that. Yeah, after that, right? Temporarily. Is it still temporarily? Yeah,  it's still temporarily technically. And he's still obviously in that four year window. Yeah. Right. Much sheer surprise I would suspect, I mean, first of all, I can't imagine being you the next day  your world must've just exploded, right? It was one of the most- You must have been terrified, I mean, did you even sleep the night before that this was coming out knowing that this was going to come out? I woke up super early. And I definitely had such a restless night,  and again, I thought I was gonna be super small, 50/50 negative positive, but it still was just, I wanted to be able to see it in the world and then never look again, right? That was my thought.  I thought I was gonna delete my Instagram. Had you seen it before? You'd seen it obviously right beforehand? Yeah, and I was able to send it to my mom, and you know what the really tragic thing too is? My first thought when I watched the video ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "What type of doping was discussed?", "Question 2": "How did the speaker respond to doping pressure?", "Question 3": "What sustenance caused concern for being banned?", "Question 4": "What medical exemptions were sought by the speaker?", "Question 5": "Who caught the speaker self-harming?", "Question 6": "What was the reaction of the speaker\u2019s parents?", "Question 7": "How did the Nike report affect the speaker?", "Question 8": "What prominent athlete\u2019s story was mentioned?", "Question 9": "What facilitated the speaker's public sharing?", "Question 10": "How did the speaker feel post-video release?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "The text discusses the use of diuretics and thyroid medications as forms of doping.", "Answer 2": "The speaker responded to doping pressure by consistently saying no to various forms of performance-enhancing drugs.

And I remember I called my mom and I was like, \"I think they're just gonna think I was the fat girl who didn't do well.\" And again, it's like that is how recent- The disorder though.  And that is how recent I was to being that deep in it. And I'll be honest, I still struggle. But my God, a year and a half different just because I was able to  almost stop treating just the food, but treat the PTSD. But I was able to see it before and that morning was insane.  And the craziest thing was I was being called, and my parents' house we're being called. I don't even know how they were getting my parents' phone number, and different news outlets wanted me to do exclusives with them.  And two competing news networks were calling me, and one kind of kept threatening that if I didn't do their thing, or if I did their competitors, then they wouldn't talk to me.  And I remember I just yelled at the woman on the phone and I was like, \"How dare you?\" I was like, \"I did not do this to get on your TV show. I did not do this  so that I could be thrust into this toxic competitive world. I did this to help people. If you don't wanna help people, okay.\" Powerful Mary Cain. But I'm one woman- Laying down the law. Literally, and I'm also like frying in the zone.  I'm a one woman PR team. My mom barely knows how to answer my email, \"Goodbye,\" and I hand up the phone. And they called me an hour later and they're like, \"Okay, we will still put you on.\" And again, I didn't even care. I thought I was gonna be  deleting and burning my social media accounts. This was not what I thought. There was a flurry, I mean, everybody had to take on this. There was so much press in the days, two days after, or three days after this thing hit.  And Lindsay kind of warned me. She was like, \"I kind of thing this is gonna be big.\" And I was just like, \"Lindsay, only runners are gonna read this.\" And so, she was incredible.  And at the time I really was managing all of this by myself. She was protecting you 'cause I reached out to her and I was like, \"Wow, this is crazy. I'd love to talk to Mary.\" And she was like, \"Yeah, I'm keeping a lid.  I'm trying to help her keep a lid on it right now.\" She was incredible. And when she even did was she connected me to Wes Felix, who's Allyson Felix's brother, and was like, \"Reach out to us,\" and was like, \"Alison went through this when she did a \"New York Times\" piece.  Right, we have to contextualize this because this came out, there's a series of Nike stuff that was all happening around this time. Most notably, the Allyson Felix pregnancy thing. Yes, and her brother Wes,  who is the most incredible person, is her agent, and ultimately became mine as well. So Lindsey reached out to him and was like, \"Mary is drowning. She doesn't know what to do. This was very unexpected.  She's handling it as well as she can, but there's only...\" You're in this weird position, right, where you're like, \"I want to keep telling this story 'cause I can help more people.\" But you're also like, \"I have no way to manage this on my own.  This is super overwhelming.\" And so, he called me up and was like, \"Just anything, forward everything along to me, I'm gonna help you sort through it. This is just me being a friend because we've been there.\" And moments like that,  and relationships being developed like that were just, again, something I'd never experienced in track. 'Cause I'm used to being at the team bonding trip where I'm being told man up pretty much,  and now I have somebody who I've met maybe once and was excited 'cause I took a picture with them being like, \"Hey, I'm here to help you. No strings attached. You're my friend wow, let me help.\" I mean, I'd never experienced that before.  You just waiting to get stabbed in the back. Oh, 100%, I mean, I'm still, sometimes I feel like turning around with certain people. But Alexi is honestly the person who taught me that you don't have to, and that there can be comradery in sport, and there can be  this ability to really be a teammate and what that means. And I think, I'm still in so many ways now shocked with how beautiful the sport is,  and how positive it can be when you find the right people. It had to be unbelievably gratifying and emotional to see the outpouring of support- I can't tell you. From teammates and all these people  who were very frank and saying like, \"I kinda knew this was going on, and I wish I'd said something and I didn't,\" or, \"I should have,\" or, \"I didn't know, but I should have,\" all of that, it was pretty unanimous. Yes.  And from all over the world. Yes. I mean, it was, I will remember to this day when even people, I told the story in \"The New York Times\" about this one specific meet,  and how I didn't race while, it was the meet that I ultimately afterwards told the sports psych and Alberto that I was cutting myself, and I didn't race well, there was a thunderstorm, we went under a tent.  I was yelled at because I clearly gained five pounds between this morning and the race time because I ate bacon and eggs. And so, I ran out into the thunderstorm. This was honestly my most suicidal moment.  After the piece came out, athletes came forward and said, \"I was there, I saw that. I was in the tent. I saw what happened and I'm sorry.\" And that,  I would never let that girl ran out by herself, and I never will. But it still means a lot that people have said, \"I'm sorry, and I was there.\"  And for me it's about empowering that person. And, first off, never letting that happen in the first place. But if that ever was to, making sure there are 10 people running after that girl  'cause she should not have done that alone. I'm sorry, I think I haven't talked about this a little bit. No, I mean, it's really, honestly, I mean, thank you for being so open about it.  And I think that recognition is beautiful, and it's critical to your own personal healing process with all of it. Oh, 100%. And I think it's also important for me  as I'm going and embarking on this new endeavor, and creating a team, and almost learning, it's important to learn what not to do, right?  I have a lot of experience with what not to do. But I think the other thing is that as much as that's good, you have to learn what to do, and you can't almost only be coming into this beautiful journey of creating a team  that I'm embarking on with a cynical perspective, which I think would be really, really easy for me to do if I'm honest. And so, there's so much importance to me- To fuck all those Nice guys team.  Yeah, exactly. That's the name of the team. Pretty much. It's really important for me to think about so many people who've helped me, and so many people who supported me through that time,  like the Alexis, or people who just, like the Wess, who stepped up and said like, \"I'm here for you.\" Because those are the people who I can lean on and learn from when creating something beautiful,  versus just kind of creating something out of a fear of what was. When you look on the past, it can't ever be like I'm just trying to rewrite my own story.  It's how can I really make something good going forward? And so that's why I do think, although obviously I've cried multiple times, it's healthy to talk about, and it's important to talk about,  especially when I just held this in for so long. And you still look back on that moment of me running out into the thunderstorm, which is so dramatic but literally what happened,  as being this almost example of how weak I was. And that was the narrative. The narrative was in my head because this is what was told to me, \"You're a head case.  This is due our fault. You're the one failing yourself.\" And for so long that's how I kind of remembered it. And to suddenly take a step back and look at it  almost from the eyes of everybody but me, it suddenly, wow, that's horrible that that happened, and how can I make sure it never does again? Yeah. It also wasn't that long ago. I mean, the pandemic,  anything pre-pandemic feels like 100 years ago, but we're talking about the end of 2019 when you came out with this. And on a personal level, you can't be a phoenix without the fire, you gotta burn, right?  And on a broader level in terms of running in general, what an incredible opportunity because you're so uniquely situated with your experience,  and the level of exposure that this story has garnered, that you're now perfectly situated to reimagine what the future of running can look like for girls and women going forward. And you've taken that, you're running with it.  You've got the Tracksmith partnership. You've got Atalanta, I said it correctly, that's all happening, and it's really inspiring. And this has all happened in a pretty compressed period of time.  I mean, I know maybe it seems like not to you, but it sounds like it to me, like in the grand scheme of things, and you're so young, and you have so much running ahead of you, and you have so much mentorship ahead of you, it's truly inspiring. No, and I really appreciate you saying that.  As I said this probably six weeks between the USADA report and when \"The New York Times\" piece came out, felt like the longest six weeks of my life. And I think, I always remember that when ever I feel like,  \"Oh gosh, things aren't happening quick enough,\" or, \"I wanna be here by X date,\" and almost I think, or at least my predisposition to push, push, push. I always looked back and I'm like, \"That was only six weeks.\"  And so, in the scheme of things, it has been a really, really short time, which is also why I'm continuing to try to learn. I think one thing that I do sometimes feel a little uncomfortable with  is that, we're all flawed individuals, right? And so, even me kind of taking this step as a mentor, and as an advocate, I have to always be very conscious of my own place in the world,  and how I can be educating myself, and learning new things, and kind of taking that next step. Because for as much as I lived my experience, there's so many other moments people can go through  that I will never experienced and I will never know. And to take that level of learning and kind of spread this in a way that's more inclusive, and not just my story  can only happen if I'm constantly trying to better myself, which is why even with this program that I'm creating and the service side of it, we're gonna create extensive educational standards for all the mentors.  Because you can't just expect a young, well, somebody of any age to be ready to kind of teach, right? You have to learn before you can teach. Right. I think you're gonna be really successful with this  because based on what you just said, there's a real appreciation for humility, and the level of empathy that you're able to bring to it,  it just feels, it's such a heart-centered thing for you, and I could tell that you've thought it completely through. So I'm excited to see what it looks like. Yeah. Thank you. I can't wait for this journey, and I know everything's gonna keep going quick,  and feeling like it's taking forever, but the more that I can stay in the present and enjoying that moment, I'd always be proud of where I am today, as much as proud of what I hope to longterm accomplish.  I think that's one thing that I'm really working on. And I also will kind of share it to anybody else who's maybe diving into their next steps, or a big endeavor for them is to appreciate the day to day and be proud of those little moments,  and those little steps in the right direction because it does go quick when you look back at least, even if not in the moment. Yeah. We got to wrap this up in a couple of minutes, but there's a couple more things I wanna touch on before I release you to your life.  I think another reason why the video really worked was that it wasn't just you telling your story. You were like, \"This this is what happened to me, but what you need to understand is that there's a systemic problem and that needs to change.  Nike needs to change. Nike is too powerful.\" And the investigation that had been launched really had nothing to do with the way that you were treated or this kind of toxic culture. It was all about the doping thing, right?  And Nike ultimately is going to do what Nike needs to do to protect its brand. So it's going to basically give lip service to this, sweep under the rug, whatever they can get away with, and move on.  And you were the one at the outset calling for a third party to conduct this investigation, Okay, so they're gonna self police themselves here? What does that actually mean? Obviously, nothing's gonna happen. So, my sense is that that didn't happen.  There is no third party investigating. Is there any update? I just wanted to know what is the 2021 status update on what's happened there? So I think first off there was an internal investigation,  and I only know this because one reporter was told that. And I was reached out for comment because I guess there was nothing released besides- Nothing public, there wasn't a public dossier or something, \"Here's what happened.\"  The only thing that was shared with this journalist, Aaron Strout, from \"Women's Running,\" was that they were gonna maybe invest more in women and stuff like that, right?  Super vague, I can't even remember what it was. And at the time I remember being asked for comment, and I was like, \"Hey, any time any movement is going towards empowering women, that's great.\"  Sure, and it's tricky and complicated because you look at Serena Williams and what they've done with her, and it's unbelievable, right? So it makes it, it's like, \"Okay,\" and then you tell your story and I don't know what to think.  Yes, well, I think part of it is that we also have no idea behind closed doors what was happening for anybody. And it's a company made up of people, right? And those individuals turn over. People tried to protest within Nike. There were like 100 people that protested right after-  Yeah, and people were threatened to be fired if they walked near the Alberto Salazar building, that's kind of scary. Is it still called The Alberto Salazar building? Yep. The new Hayward Field, there's a Memorial to him.  There's a big picture at a stadium that I'll probably have to run it multiple times over the course of my career. Oh my God, yeah. And that was built after, it was only recently finished, a couple months ago. That's right, they just redid it. And then they did a reboot.  So, I think for me, it's one of those things where, as you know, you've seen him through the documentation I've sent you for this my own business that I'm trying to start. I don't like using buzzwords, and I try to avoid it at all costs.  So if I say like, \"I'm trying to empower women,\" that means nothing to me, right? This is actually what I'm gonna do, and I'm gonna outlay steps, A, B, C, where we're gonna go, how we're gonna support it. And you know what, if I don't have an answer yet,  that's always okay. But then say, I'm gonna have to lean on these partners, and these experts, and take these next steps. And so, I think the big maybe takeaways  if you're a multi-billion dollar organization, is actually care, and actually figure out like, \"Okay, if we're gonna do something, what are we gonna do? And how are we gonna do it?\"  And don't just keep coming out with ads that even recently support women who are pregnant and are athletes, right? 'Cause I watched that, and I think,  \"You've never acknowledged how you treated Kara, Alicea, Alison,\" there's never been any sort of like, \"Hey, we did wrong.\" And I think I have always felt that  leaders are not people who do everything right. Leaders are people who are always trying to better themselves. Always know they have places to learn, and can acknowledge that they're going to fail some times.  And in those moments can step up and say, \"I'm sorry, and this is how I'm going to change going forward.\" Sure. They take responsibility.  I see it as, look you can try to whitewash this, and put out a bunch of marketing campaigns, and the truth is the average public isn't paying attention to this. No, of course, yeah. So, it's not, is it? So, how concerned are they really?  But ultimately, it seems to me in their long-term growth interest to really reckon with this, the amount of goodwill that they would be able to engender if the new CEO said, \"I'm getting to the bottom of this.  I'm taking it super seriously,\" and they really did do a top to bottom revamp on how they're dealing with all of these issues, the amount of storytelling alone that they could do out of that  would create a bulletproof brand going forward. And they have the balance sheet to be able to make that happen. Yeah, I mean, I remember when the first kind of comments from Nike came out after my piece, first, I never thought they were gonna comment  'cause I never thought it was gonna be big enough, but the fact that it was immediately blaming and trying to undermine the story, to me it was just horrifying.  But the thing is, so Alberto- That backfired badly though. Yes, I mean, Alberto is still, I think is still kind of, the USADA appeal has been, I think it's complete at this point.  I'm not sure as of when the podcast release, whether or not there'll be any sort of findings, we're still waiting on the final SafeSport ruling about whether this is an indefinite ban for him via SafeSport.  So there's still two different investigations that are yet to be fully determined. But the thing is that his whole legal pursuit with USADA  and with SafeSport is being backed by Nike. And they've been very public that they're supporting him in his appeals. And I think that's one of those moments where you're just like, \"How can you not just listen to my story,  but listen to Kara's, and Amy Yoder Begley, and all of these other athletes who have come forward and said, 'This happened to them,' and still try to shut them down.\"  And I think when you live in a world where there's that amount of power, and there's that much of a will to take away an athlete's voice, it makes me want to live in a world  where you're empowering those athletes and giving them voice. And that's really my goal, is I want the sport to be better once I leave it. I want athletes to be more empowered. I want them to be protected. I want them to be safe. I want them to be healthy.  And I think when I was young, I always wanted to be the greatest professional athlete in the world. And the truth is I still want that. But I think my definition of greatness has changed. And I realize that if I had won  all of the races I ever wanted to win, but I never stood for anything, that's not great. To me that's going of lame.  And if I end my career having really changed the sport in a positive way, that's greatness. And so, that's what I strive for. It's crazy how that works, right? Because you would have suspected that  the way for you to have the biggest impact is to go win a bunch of gold medals, or set world records, or what have you. And maybe that'll still happen. Hopefully. I'm interested in where you're running is right now. But completely detached or irrespective of that  because of all of these things you're now in a position to have a real, permanent, meaningful, substantive impact on the future of girls and women's athletics. That never would have happened  had you not endured the things that you went through. Yeah, and I think, the thing that's hard for me sometimes is that the dream I had as a young athlete of being a professional.  And I used to be a swimmer too. So I used to keep that a little vague which way we'd go. I know. It cropped up here and there. Exactly. I know. While you're running 5:47 miles in sixth grade.  Yeah, I was still swimming, that was my primary sport. Swimmers don't know how to run. So there's something weird there. I see triathlon in your future. Yeah. We'll see. Okay. But I think the hardest thing can sometimes be is that  the dream I had can now never happen, right? Where the dream was to be a professional athlete, and to train full time, and to be the LeBron James, the Serena Williams,  the insert any of the top athletes in the world, the Usain Bolt, right.? And the truth is even if I win the Olympics, I can't be that person.  That dream was taken away from me because I'm not a professional athlete on paper. And the thing is, it's been this really interesting reworking  of how do you let one dream die and let another one blossom? And I think that's kind of what this last year and a half has been for me is accepting I can do something different,  and still love it, and still be proud of it. And that's been kind of an interesting, I would say journey, of realizing that how a dream is lived has to sometimes change.  Beautifully put. I think that's a good place to put a pin on it until next time. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. That was really powerful. I appreciate you being so open and honest with me about all of that. No, and thank you for giving me the space to cry,  to at times move my arms. Are you kidding? I love it when people, it's been a long time since somebody cried on the podcast. You might be the first person to cry in the new studio, so you'll always have that. I've christened it with my tears. Yeah. If I come to New York,  will you go running with me and Lindsay Crouse? Can we go running together? Oh my God, that'd be amazing. You guys have to run real slow though, slow down a lot. Sounds great to me, I'll allow it. That would be super fun.  And don't steal Alexi, Alexi is my BFF, she's my neighbor now. So just boundaries. You're going over to her house right now, right? Nearly guessed. Just understand that I have dibs. I think I've known her longer. I think I win. That doesn't matter.  She lives here now. I'm being protective and- I know, I think long-term, how do we get her to New York though? I'm like putting the long game. I like her down the street from me. I don't want her to go to New York. Maybe you do, put her on your board. Yeah, true. Very true.  Awesome, well, I look forward to going running with you, and talking more, so thanks. How can people find out more about how to Atalanta?

(Elon whistling)  I thought you were gonna finish it. (Elon whistling) It's one of the greatest themes in all film history. (whistling continues) - Yeah, that's great. - So I was just thinking about the Roman Empire.  As one does. (Elon laughing) - There's that whole meme where old guys are thinking about the Roman Empire at least once a day. - And half the population's confused whether it's true or not. But more seriously thinking about the wars  going on in the world today. And as you know, war and military conquest has been a big part of Roman society and culture. And it, I think, has been a big part of most empires and dynasties throughout human history, so.  - Yeah, they usually came as a result of conquest. I mean, there's some, like the Hungarian Empire where there was just a lot of sort of clever marriages. - But fundamentally there's an engine of conquest.  They celebrate excellence in warfare. Many of the leaders were excellent generals. - [Elon] Yeah. - That kind of thing. So a big picture question, Grok approved, I asked if this is a good question to ask. - [Elon] Get tested Grok approved.  - Yeah. At least on fun mode. (Elon laughing) To what degree do you think war is part of human nature versus a consequence of  how human societies are structured? I ask this as you have somehow controversially been a proponent of peace. - I'm generally a proponent of peace. I mean, ignorance is perhaps, in my view, the real enemy to be countered.  That's the real hard part. Not, you know, fighting other humans. But all creatures fight. I mean, the jungle is a, you look at the, people think of this nature as perhaps some sort of peaceful thing. But in fact it is not.  There's some quite funny Werner Herzog thing where he is like in the jungle, like saying that it's like basically just murder and death in every direction. I mean, the plants, animals in the jungle are constantly trying to kill each other,  every single day, every minute. So it's not like, you know, we're unusual in that respect. - Well, there's a relevant question here. Whether with greater intelligence comes greater control over these base instincts for violence.  - Yes. We have much more vulnerability to control our limbic instinct for violence than say a chimpanzee. And in fact, if one looks and say, chimpanzee society, it is not friendly. I mean, the Bonobos are an exception,  but chimpanzee society is filled with violence. And it's quite, quite horrific, frankly, that that's our limbic system in action. Like, you don't wanna be on the wrong side of a chimpanzee,  they'll eat your face off and tear and nuts off. - Yeah, basically, there's no limits or ethics or there almost had just war. There's no just war in chimpanzee societies, is war and dominance by any means necessary. - Yeah, chimpanzee society is a pro,  like a permanent version of human society. They're not like peace loving basically at all. There's extreme violence. And then once in a while, somebody who's watched too many Disney movies decides to raise a chimpanzee as a pet,  and then that eats their face or rip their nuts off or chew their fingers off and that kind of thing. It's happened several times. - Ripping your nuts off is an interesting strategy for interaction. - It's happened to people. It's unfortunate. Like that's, I guess a one way to ensure  that the other chimp doesn't like, you know, contribute to the gene pool. - Well, from a martial arts perspective is the fascinating strategy. - (laughing) The nut riper. (laughing) - I wonder which of the martial arts teaches that one.  - I think it's safe to say if somebody's got your nuts in their hands and as the option ripping them off, you'll be amenable to whatever they want. - Yeah. (Elon laughing) - So like I said, somehow controversially,  you've been an proponent of peace on Twitter, on X. - Yeah. - So let me ask you about the wars going on today and to see what the path to peace could be. How do you hope the current war in Israel and Gaza comes to an end? What path do you see  that can minimize human suffering in the long term in that part of the world? - Well, I think that part of the world is definitely like, if you look up the, there is no easy answer in the dictionary. It'll be that, like the picture of the Middle East,  in Israel especially. So there is no easy answer. What my, this is strictly my opinion of, you know, is that the goal  of Hamas was to provoke an overreaction from Israel. They obviously did not expect to, you know, have a military victory, but they expect, they really wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke  the most aggressive response possible from Israel. And then leverage that aggressive response to rally Muslims worldwide  for the course of Gaza and Palestine, which they have succeeded in doing. So the counterintuitive thing here, I think that the thing that I think should be done, even though it's very difficult,  is that I would recommend that Israel engage in the most conspicuous acts of kindness possible. Every po- everything. That is the actual thing that we're taught the goal of Hamas. - So in some sense,  the degree that makes sense in geopolitics turn the other cheek implemented. - It's not exactly turn the other cheek. Because I do think that there's, you know, I think it is appropriate for Israel  to find the Hamas members and, you know, either kill 'em or incarcerate them. Like that's something that's something has to be done 'cause they're just gonna keep coming otherwise.  But in addition to that, they need to do whatever they can. There's some talk of establishing, for example, a mobile hospital. I'd recommend doing that.  Just making sure that, you know, there's food, water, medical, necessities, and just be over the top about it and be very transparent.  So you can't claim it's a trick. Like just put webcam on the thing, you know, or 24/7. - Deploy acts of kindness. - Yeah. Conspicuous acts of kindness that,  with that are unequivocal. Meaning they can't be somehow, because Hamas will then, their response will be, oh, it's a trick. Therefore you have to counter how it's not a trick. - This ultimately fights the broader force  of hatred in the region. - Yes. And I'm not sure who said it, it's an apocryphal saying, but an eye for an eye makes everyone blind. Now that neck of the woods, they really believe in the whole eye for an eye thing.  But I mean, you really have, if you're not gonna just outright commit genocide, like against an entire people, which obviously would not be acceptable to really shouldn't be acceptable to anyone,  then you're gonna leave basically a lot of people alive who subsequently, you know, hate Israel. So really the question is like, how, for every Hamas member that you kill, how many did you create?  And if you create more than you killed, you've not succeeded. That's the, you know, the real situation there. And it's safe to say that if, you know,  if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you've made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.  That's the situation. So, but I mean, this is one of the most contentious subjects one could possibly discuss. But I think if the goal ultimately is some sort of long-term peace,  one has to be, look at this from the standpoint of, over time, are there more or fewer terrorists being created? - Let me just linger on war. - Yeah, war safe to say,  wars always existed and always will exist. - [Lex] Always will exist, - Always has existed and always will exist. - I hope not. You think it always will? - There will always be war. This question of just how much war.  And, you know, there's this, there's this sort of the scope and scale of war. But to imagine that there would not be any war in the future, I think would be a very unlikely outcome. - Yeah you talked about the Culture series. There's war even there.  - Yes. It's a giant war. The first book starts off with a gigantic galactic war where trillions die, trillions. - But it still nevertheless protects these pockets of flourishing.  Somehow you can have galactic war and still have pockets of flourishing. - Yeah. I mean it's, I guess if we are able to one day expand to, you know, the galaxy or whatever,  there will be a galactic war at some point. - The scale, I mean the scale of war has been increasing, increasing, increasing. It's like a race between the scale of suffering and the scale of flourishing. - Yes.  - A lot of people seem to be using this tragedy to beat the drums of war and feed the military industrial complex. Do you worry about this? The people who are rooting for escalation and how can it be stopped? - One of the things that did concerned me  is that there are very few people alive today who actually viscerally understand the horrors of war, at least in the US. I mean, obviously there are people in on the front lines in Ukraine and Russia who understand just how terrible war is, but how many people in the west understand it?  And my grandfather was in World War II. He was severely traumatized. He was there, I think for almost six years in the, in eastern North Africa and Italy. All his friends were killed in front of him.  And he would've died too, except they randomly gave some, I guess, IQ test or something. And he scored very high. And he was not an officer, he was a, I think a corporal or a sergeant or something like that.  Because he didn't finish high school because he had to drop outta high school, 'cause his dad died and he had to work to support his siblings. So because he didn't graduate high school, he was not eligible for the officer corps.  So, you know, he kind of got put into the cannon fodder category, basically. But then, this, randomly they gave him this test. He was transferred to British intelligence in London. That's where he met my grandmother.  But he had PTSD next level, like next level. I mean, just didn't talk, just didn't talk. And if you tried talking to him, he'd just tell you to shut up. And he won a bunch of medals.  Never bragged about it once, not even hinted, nothing. I like found out about it, 'cause his military records were online. That's how I know. So he would say like, no way in hell  do you wanna do that again. But how many people, now he obviously he died, you know, 20 years ago or longer, actually 30 years ago. How many people are alive that remember World War II? Not many.  - And the same perhaps applies to the threat of nuclear war. - Yeah. I mean, there are enough nuclear bombs pointed at United States to make the revel, the radio active revel balance many times.  - There's two major wars going on right now. So you talked about the threat of AGI quite a bit. But now as we sit here with the intensity of conflict going on, do you worry about nuclear war?  - I think we shouldn't discount the possibility of nuclear war. It is a civilizational threat. Right now I could be wrong, but I think the current probability of nuclear war  is quite low. But there are a lot of nukes pointed at us. So, and we have a lot of nukes pointed at other people. They're still there. Nobody's put their guns away.  The missiles are still in the silos. - And the leaders don't seem to be the ones with the nukes talking to each other. - No. There are wars which are tragic and difficult on a local basis.  And then there are wars which are civilization ending or has that potential. Obviously global thermonuclear warfare has high potential to end civilization, perhaps permanently. But certainly, you know, to severely wound  and perhaps set back human progress by, you know, to the stone age or something, I don't know. Pretty bad.  Probably scientists and engineers wanna be super popular after that as well. And like you got us into this mess. - So generally I think we obviously wanna prioritize civilizational risks over things that are painful  and tragic on a local level, but not civilizational. - How do you hope the war in Ukraine comes to an end? And what's the path, once again to minimizing human suffering there?  - Well, I think that what is likely to happen, which is really pretty much the way it is, is that something very close to the current lines will be  how a ceasefire or truth happens. But, you know, you just have a situation right now where whoever goes on the offensive will suffer casualties at several times the rate of whoever's on the defense.  'Cause you've got defense in depth, you've got minefields, trenches, anti-tank defenses. Nobody has air superiority. 'cause the anti-aircraft missiles are really far better than the aircraft. Like, they're far more of them.  And so neither side has air superiority. Tanks are basically death drafts, just slow moving and they're not immune to anti-tank weapons. So you really just have long range artillery  and infantry ranges. It's World War I all over again with drones, you know, throwing old drones, some drones there. - Which makes the long range artillery just that much more accurate and better  and so more efficient at murdering people on both sides. - Yeah. So it's whoever is, you don't wanna be trying to advance from either side, 'cause the probability of dying is incredibly high.  So in order to overcome defense in depth trenches and minefields, you really need a significant local superiority in numbers.  Ideally combined alms where you do a fast attack with aircraft, a concentrated number of tanks and a lot of people. That's the only way you're gonna punch through the line. And then you're gonna punch through  and then not have reinforcements just kick you right out again. I mean, I really recommend people read World War I warfare in detail. That's rough.  I mean, the sheer number of people that died there was mind boggling. - And it's almost impossible to imagine the end of it that doesn't look like almost exactly like the beginning in terms of what land belongs to who and so on.  But on the other side of a lot of human suffering death and destruction of infrastructure. - Yes. I mean, the thing that, the reason I, you know, proposed some sort of truce  or peace a year ago was because I've predicted pretty much exactly what would happen, which is a lot of people dying for basically almost no changes in land.  And this, the loss of the flower of Ukrainian and Russian youth. And we should have some sympathy for the Russian boys as well as the Ukrainian boys, 'cause they, Russian boys didn't ask to be on their front line, they have to be.  So there's a lot of sons not coming back to their parents, you know, and I think most of 'em don't really have, they don't hate the other side.  You know, it's sort of like as this saying about, like, this saying comes from World War I, it's like young boys who don't know each other, killing each other on behalf of old men that do know each other. The hell's the point of that?  - So Vladimir Zelensky said that he's not, or has said in the past, he's not interested in talking to Putin directly. Do you think he should? - Yeah. - Sit down man to man, lead a leader and negotiate peace? - Look, I think I would just recommend  do not send the flower of Ukrainian youth to die in trenches. Whether he talks to Putin or not, just don't do that. Whoever goes on the offensive  will lose massive numbers of people and history will not look kindly upon them. - You've spoken honestly about the possibility of war between US and China in the long term.  If no diplomatic solution is found, for example, on the question of Taiwan and one China policy. - [Elon] Right. - How do we avoid the trajectory where these two superpowers clash? - Well, it's worth reading that book  on the, difficult to pronounce, the Thucydides trap, I believe it's called. I love war history. I like inside out and backwards. There's hardly a battle I haven't read about.  And trying to figure out like what really was the cause of victory in any particular case as opposed to what one side or another claim the reason. - Both the victory and what sparked the war? - Yeah, yeah, - [Lex] The whole thing.  - Yeah, so that Athens and Sparta is a classic case. The thing about the Greek is they really wrote down a lot of stuff. They loved writing. You know, there are lots of interesting things that happened in many parts of the world, but people didn't write down. (laughing) So we don't know what happened,  or they didn't really write with in detail. They just would say like, we had a battle and we won. And like, well what? Can you add a bit more? The Greeks, they really wrote a lot. (laughing)  They were very articulate on, they just love writing. So, and we have a bunch of that writing as preserved. So we know what led up to the Peloponnesian War between the Spartan and Athenian alliance.  And we know that they saw it coming. I mean, the Spartans didn't write, they also weren't very verbose by their nature, but they did write, but they weren't very verbose. They were terse.  But the Athenians and the other Greeks wrote a line and they were like, and Sparta was really kinda like the leader of Greece. But Athens grew stronger and stronger with each passing year.  And everyone's like, well that's inevitable that there's gonna be a clash between Athens and Sparta. Well, how do we avoid that? And they couldn't. They actually, they saw it coming and they still could not avoid it. (laughing)  So, you know, at some point if there's, if one group, one civilization or country or whatever exceeds another, sort of, like, you know,  the United States has been the biggest kid on the block for, since I think around 1890 from an economic standpoint. So the United States has been the economic, most powerful economic engine in the world,  longer than anyone's been alive. And the foundation of war is economics. So now we have a situation in the case  of China where the economy is likely to be two, perhaps three times larger than that of the US. So imagine you're the biggest kid on the block for as long as anyone can remember. And suddenly a kid comes along who's twice your size.  - So we see it coming. - [Elon] Yeah. - How is it possible to stop? Is there some, let me throw something out there, just intermixing of cultures understanding. There does seem to be a giant cultural gap in understanding of each other. And you're an interesting case study  because you are an American, obviously you've done a lot of incredible manufacture here in the United States, but you also work with China. - I've spent a lot of time in China and met with the leadership many times. - Maybe a good question to ask is, what are some things about China  that people don't understand positive, just in the culture? What's some interesting things that you've learned about the Chinese? - Well, the sheer number of really smart,  hardworking people in China is incredible. There are really, say like how many smart, hardworking people are there in China, there's far more of them there than there are here. I think in my opinion.  And they've got a lot of energy. So I mean, the architecture in China that's in recent years is far more impressive than the US. I mean the train stations, the buildings, the high speed rail, everything,  it's really far more impressive than what we have in the US. I mean, I recommend somebody just go to Shanghai and Beijing, look at the buildings and go to, you know, take the train from Beijing to Xian,  where you have the terracotta warriors. China's got an incredible history, very long history. And you know, I think arguably the, in terms of the use of language from a written standpoint,  sort of one of the oldest, perhaps the oldest written language. And then China, people did write things down. So now China historically has always been,  with rare exception, been internally focused. They have not been inquisitive. They've fought each other. There've been many, many civil wars. In the three kingdoms war, I believe they lost about 70% of their population.  So, and that, so they've had brutal internal wars, like civil wars that make the US Civil War look small by comparison.  So I think it's important to appreciate that China is not monolithic. We sort of think of like China as this sort of one entity of one mind. And this is definitely not the case  from what I've seen, and I think most people who understand China would agree. People in China think about China 10 times more than they think about anything outside of China. So it's like 90% of their consideration is,  you know, our is internal. - Well, isn't that a really positive thing when you're talking about the collaboration and a future piece between superpowers, when you're inward facing, which is like focusing on improving yourself versus focusing on... - [Elon] Yeah.  - \"Improving\" others through military might. - The good news, the history of China suggests that China is not inquisitive. Meaning they're not gonna go out and invade a whole bunch of countries. Now they do feel very strongly, you know, so that's good.  I mean, 'cause a lot of very powerful countries have been inquisitive. The US is one of the, also one of the rare cases that has not been inquisitive. Like after World War II, the US could have basically taken over the world in any country.  Like, we've got nukes, nobody else has got nukes. We don't even have to lose soldiers. Which country do you want? And the United States could have taken over everything. Oh wait, at will. And it didn't, and the United States actually helped rebuild countries.  So it helped rebuild Europe, you know, helped rebuild Japan. This is very unusual behavior, almost unprecedented. You know, the US did conspicuous acts of kindness  like the Berlin airlift, you know? And I think, you know, it's always like, well, America's done bad things. Well, of course America's done bad things. But one needs to look at the whole track record.  And just generally, you know, one sort of test would be how do you treat your prisoners at war? Or let's say, you know,  no offense to the Russians, but let's say you're in Germany, it's 1945, you got the Russian Army coming one side and you got the French, British, and American Army's coming the other side. Who would you like to be to surrender it to? Like, no country is like morally perfect,  but I recommend being a POW with the Americans. That would be my choice very strongly. (laughing) - In the full menu of POWs. - Very much so.  And in fact, Wernher von Braun, took, you know, smart guy was like, we've got to be captured by the Americans. And in fact, the SS was under orders to execute Von Braun  and all of the German rocket initiatives. And they narrowly escaped their SS. They said they were going out for a walk in the woods. They left in the middle of winter with no coats.  And they ran like, with no food, no coats, no water. And just ran like hell and ran west. And by Sherlock, they, I think his brother found like a bicycle or something, and then just cycled west as fast  as he couldn't have found a US patrol. So anyway, that's one way you can tell morality is. Where do you wanna be PoW? (laughing) It's not fun anywhere,  but some places are much worse than others. So anyways, so like America has been, while far from perfect, generally a benevolent force, and we should always be self-critical  and we try to be better. But anyone with have brain knows that. So I think there are some, in this way China and the United States are similar.  Neither country has been acquisitive in a significant way. So that's like a, you know, a shared principle I guess. Now China does feel very strongly about Taiwan.  They've been very clear about that for a long time. You know, from their standpoint, it would be like one of the states is, you know, not there like Hawaii or something like that. But more significant than Hawaii, you know?  And Hawaii is pretty significant for us. So they view it as really the, that there's a fundamental part of China. The islander Formosa not Taiwan,  that is not part of China, but should be. And the only reason it hasn't been is 'cause the US Pacific Fleet. - And as their economic power grows and as their military power grows, the thing that they're clearly saying  is their interest will, you know, clearly be materialized. - Yes. China has been very clear that they'll incorporate Taiwan  peacefully or militarily, but that they will incorporate it from their standpoint is 100% likely. - You know, something you said about conspicuous acts of kindness.  As a geopolitical policy, it almost seems naive, but I'd venture to say that this is probably the path forward, how you avoid most wars.  Just as you say it, it sounds naive, but it's kind of brilliant. If you believe in the goodness of underlying most of human nature. It just seems like it conspicuous acts of kindness  can reverberate through the populace of the countries involved. - Yeah, well. - [Lex] And deescalate. - Absolutely. So after World War I, they made a big mistake.

And, you know, really, there was a lot of, there was a fair, quite a bit of blame to go around for World War I, but they try to, you know, put it all in Germany.  And that was, that laid the seeds for World War II. So it's a lot of people were not just Hitler, a lot of people felt wronged  and they wanted vengeance and they got it. - [Lex] People don't forget. - Yeah, you know, you kill somebody's father  or mother or son, daughter, they're not gonna forget it. They'll want vengeance. So after World War II, they're like, well, the Treaty of Versailles was a huge mistake in World War I.  And so this time, instead of, you know, crushing the losers, we're actually gonna help 'em with the Marshall Plan  and we're gonna help rebuild Germany. We're gonna help rebuild or, you know, Austria and the other, you know, Italy and whatnot, so.  And that was the right move. - There's a, it does feel like there's a profound truth to conspicuous acts of kindness being an antidote to this. - Something must stop the cycle of reciprocal violence.  Something must stop it or it will, you know, it'll never stop. Just eye for an eye, tooth for tooth, limb for a limb, life for a life, forever and ever  - To escape briefly, the darkness was some incredible engineering work. xAI just released Grok AI assistant that I've gotten a chance to play with. It's amazing on many levels. First of all, it's amazing that a relatively small team  in a relatively short amount of time was able to develop this close to state-of-the art system. Another incredible thing is there's a regular mode and there's a fun mode. - Yeah. I guess I'm to blame for that one. (laughing)  - I wish, first of all, I wish everything in life had a fun mode. - Yeah. - There's something compelling beyond just fun about the fun mode interacting with a large language model. I'm not sure exactly what it is 'cause I only have had a little bit of time to play with it.  But it just makes it more interesting, more vibrant to interact with the system. - Yeah, absolutely. Our AI Grok is modeled after the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,  which is one of my favorite books, which is, it's a book on philosophy, disguises book on humor. And I would say that is that forms the basis of my philosophy, which is that  we don't know the meaning of life, but the more we can expand the scope and scale of consciousness, digital and biological, the more we're able to understand  what questions to ask about the answer that is the universe. So I have a philosophy of curiosity. - There is generally a feeling like this AI system has an outward looking,  like the way you are, like sitting with a good friend looking up at the stars, like the asking pod head, like questions about the universe, wondering what it's all about. The curiosity you talk about. There's a sense no matter how mundane the question I ask,  there's a sense of cosmic grandeur to the whole thing. - Well we are actually working hard to have engineering math, physics answers that you can count on.  So for the other sort of AIs out there that these so-called large language models, I've not found the engineering to be reliable. And the hallucination,  it unfortunately hallucinates most when you at least want it to hallucinate. So when you're asking important difficult questions, that that's where it tends to be confidently wrong. So we're really trying hard to say, okay,  how do we be as grounded as possible so you can count on the results? Trace things back to physics first principles, mathematical logic. So underlying the humor is an aspiration  to adhere to the truth of the universe as closely as possible. - [Lex] That's really tricky. - It is tricky. So that's why, you know, there's always gonna be some amount of error,  but we want to aspire to be as truthful as possible about the answers with acknowledged error. So that there was always, you don't wanna be confidently  wrong, so you're not gonna be right every time, but you wanna minimize how often you're confidently wrong. And then like I said, once you can count on the logic  as being not violating physics, then you can start to build on that, to create inventions, like invent new technologies. But if you can't, if you cannot  count on the foundational physics being correct, obviously the inventions are simply wishful thinking, you know, imagination land, magic basically. - Well, as you said, I think one of the big goals  of xAI is to understand the universe. - Yes. That's how simple three word mission. (laughing) - If you look out far into the future, do you think on this level of physics, the very edge of what we understand about physics,  do you think it will make discoveries, sort of the sexiest discovery of them as we know now, sort of unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics. So coming up with a theory of everything, do you think it could push towards that direction?  Almost like theoretical physics discoveries. - If an AI cannot figure out new physics, it's clearly not equal to humans, let alone nor has surpassed humans, 'cause humans have figured out new physics. They're just, you know, physics is just understanding,  you know, deepening wants insight into how reality works. And then there's engineering which is inventing things that have never existed. Now the range of possibilities for engineering is far greater than for physics.  'Cause you know, once you figure out the rules of the universe, that's it. You've discovered things that already existed. But from that you can then build technologies with that are really almost limitless  in the variety and cap- you know? It's like once you understand the rules of the game properly, and we do, you know, with current physics, we do at least at a local level, understand how physics works very well.  Where our ability to predict things is incredibly good. Like quantum mechanics is, the degree to which quantum mechanics can predict outcomes is incredible. That was my heart hardest class in college by the way.  My senior quantum mechanics class was harder than all of my other classes put together. - To get an AI system, a large language model to reliably, be as reliable as quantum mechanics and physics is very difficult.  - Yeah. You have to test any conclusions against the ground, truth of reality. Reality is the ultimate judge. Like physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation. I've seen plenty of people break the laws made by man, but none break the laws made by physics. - Yeah, it's a good test actually.  If this LLM understands and matches physics, then you can more reliably trust whatever it thinks about the current state of politics in some sense. - And it's also not the case currently  that even that its internal logic is not consistent. So, especially with these, with the approach of like just predicting a token, predict, token, predict, token, it's like a vector sum.  You know, you're summing up a bunch of vectors, but you can get drift. So as those, a little bit of error, a little bit of error adds up. And by the time you are many tokens down the path, it doesn't make any sense.  - So it has to be somehow self-aware about the drift. - It has to be self-aware about the drift, and then look at the thing as a gestalt as a whole and say it does it have coherence as a whole.  So, you know, when authors write books that they will write the book and then they'll go and revise it, you know, taking into account, you know, all the, the end and the beginning  and the middle and rewrite it to achieve coherence so that it doesn't end up in a nonsensical place. - [Lex] Maybe the process of revising is what... - Yeah. - Reasoning is, and then that's the process of revising is how you get closer and closer to truth.  Maybe you, like, at least I approached it that way. You just say a bunch of bullshit first and then you get it better. You start a bullshit and then you get... - Create a draft and then you iterate on that draft until it has has coherence,  until it all adds up basically. - So another question about theory of everything, but for intelligence, do you think there exists as you're exploring this with xAI, creating this intelligence system, do you think there is a theory of intelligence  where you get to understand what, like what is the I in AGI and what is the I in human intelligence? - There's no I in Team America, oh wait, there is.  (both laughing) - No, it's gonna be stuck in my head now. (both laughing) Yeah. There's no me and whatever in quantum mechanics. Oh, wait. (Elon laughing)  I mean is that part of the process of discovering, understanding the universe is understanding intelligence? - Yeah. Yeah. I think we need to understand intelligence, understand consciousness.  I mean there are some sort of fundamental questions of like, what is thought? What is emotion? - [Lex] Yeah. - Is it really just one atom bumping into another atom? It feels like something more than that.  So I think we're probably missing some really big things, like some really big things. - Something that'll be obvious in retrospect. - [Elon] Yes. - Like there's a giant,  like you put the whole consciousness, emotion. - Well, some people would quote like a soul, you know, in religion it'd be a soul. Like you feel like you're you, right? I mean, you don't feel like you're just a collection  of atoms, but on what dimension does thought exist? What dimension does do emotions exist? We feel them very strongly. I suspect there's more to it than atoms bumping into atoms.  - And maybe AI can pave the path to the discovery of whatever the hell that thing is. - Yeah. What is consciousness? Like what are, when you put the atoms in a particular shape, why are they able to form thoughts  and take actions, that and feelings. - And even if it is an illusion, why is this illusion so compelling? - Yeah. Like how do... - Why does this illusion exist? - [Lex] Yeah. - On what plain  does this illusion exist? - [Lex] Yeah. - And sometimes I wonder is, you know, either perhaps everything's conscious or nothing is conscious, one of the two. - I like the former,  everything conscious just seems more fun. - It does seem more more fun. Yes. But we're composed of atoms and those atoms are composed of quarks and leptons. And those quarks and leptons have been around since the beginning of the universe.  - The beginning of the universe. - Right. What seems to be the beginning of the universe. - The first time we talked, you said what you would, which is surreal to think that this discussion was happening is becoming a reality. I asked you what question would you ask an AGI system  once you create it? And you said, what's outside the simulation is the question. And good question. - [Elon] Yeah. - But it seems like with Grok you started to literally, the system's goal is to be able to ask such questions,  to answer such questions and to ask such questions. - Where are the aliens? - [Lex] Where are the aliens? - That's one of the, like the very paradox question. A lot of people have asked me if I've seen any evidence of aliens and I haven't, which is kind of concerning.  'Cause then I think what I'd probably prefer to at least have seen some archeological evidence of aliens, to the best of my knowledge, there is no proof. I'm not aware of any evidence of aliens. If they're out there, they're very subtle.  We might just be the only consciousness, at least in the galaxy. And if you look at say the history of Earth, forensically the archeological record, Earth is about four and a half billion years old.  Civilization as measured from the first writing is only about 5,000 years old. We have to give some credit there to the ancient Sumerians who aren't around anymore. I think it was a archaic, pre cuneiform was the first actual symbolic representation,  but only about 5,000 years ago. I think that's a good date for when word say civilization started. That's one millionth of Earth's existence. So civilization has been around,  it's really a flash in the pan so far. And why have we, why did it take so long for,  you know, four and a half billion years? For the vast majority of the time, there was no life. And then there was archaic there bacteria for a very long time.  And then, you know, you had mitochondria get captured, multicellular life. Differentiation into plants and animals. Life moving from the oceans to land.  Mammals, higher brain functions. And the sun is expanding slowly, but it will overheat,  it will heat the earth up at some point in the future, boil the oceans and and earth will become like Venus. Where near life, life as we know it is impossible. So if we do not become multi-planetary  and ultimately go beyond our solar system, annihilation of all life on earth is a certainty. A certainty.  And it could be as little as on the galactic timescale, half a billion years. You know, it's long time by human standards, but that's only 10% longer than earth has been around at all.  So if life had taken 10% longer to evolve on earth, it wouldn't exist at all. - We got a deadline coming up. Better hurry.  But that said, as you said, humans intelligent life on earth developed a lot of cool stuff very quickly, - So... - [Elon] Yes. - It seems like becoming a multi-planetary is almost inevitable.  Unless we destroy this thing. - We need to do it. I mean, it's not, I mean, I suspect that there, if we are able to go out there and explore other star systems that we, there's a good chance we find a whole bunch  of long dead one planet civilizations, then have made it past their home planet. - That's so sad. - Yeah. - It's sad. Also fascinating. - I mean, there are various explanations for exploring paradox. And one is the sort of, they're these great vultures,  which civilizations don't pass through. And one of those great filters is do you become a multi-plan civilization or not? And if you don't, it's simply a matter of time before something happens on your planet.  You know, either natural or manmade that causes us to die out. Like the dinosaurs, where are they now that didn't have spaceships, so. (laughing) - I think the more likely thing is,  'cause just to empathize with the aliens that they found us and they're protecting us and letting us be. - I hope so. Nice aliens. - Just like the tribes in the Amazon, the uncontacted tribes, we're protecting them. That's what...  - That would be a nice explanation. - Or you could have like a, what was it? I think Andrej Karpathy said, it's like the ants in the Amazon asking where's everybody? - Well, they do run into a lot of other ants. - [Lex] That's true. - They have these ant wars.  - (laughing) Sounds like a good TV show. - Yeah, they literally have these big wars between various ants. - Yeah, maybe I'm just (both laughing) dismissing all the different diversity events. - You should listen to that Warner Herzog talking about the jungle.  It's really hilarious. Have you heard it? - No, I have not. - [Elon] It's awesome. - But Warner Herzog is a way... (both laughing) - You should play it for the, you know, as an interlude in the, it's on YouTube. It's awesome. (both laughing)  - [Lex] I love him so much. - Yeah, he's great. - Was he the director of \"Happy People: Life in the Taiga\"? I think also - He did that bear documentary, - [Lex] The bear documentary. - And this thing about penguins. - Yeah. (both laughing) The analysis, the psychoanalysis of penguins.  - Yeah, the penguins like headed for like mountains like that are like 70 miles away. And Penguin has just had for doom basically. - Well, he had a cynical take. I have a, he could be just a brave explorer and there'll be great stories told  about him amongst the penguin population for many centuries to come. (laughing) What were we talking about? Okay. - [Elon] Penguins. (both laughing) - Yeah, so aliens, I mean, I don't know.  Look, I think the smart move is just, you know, this is the first time in the history of earth that it's been possible for life to extend beyond earth. That window is open.  Now, it may be open for a long time or it may be open for a short time and it may be open now and then never open again. So I think the smart move here is to make life multiplanetary while it's possible to do so. We don't wanna be one of those  lame one planet civilizations that just dies out. - No, those are lame. - Yeah, lame. Self-respecting civilization would be one planet. - There's not gonna be a Wikipedia entry for one of one of those.  And pause, the SpaceX have an official policy for when we meet aliens. - No. (laughing) - That seems irresponsible. (both laughing)  - I mean, look, if I see the slightest indication that there are aliens, I will immediately post on X platform anything I know. - It could be the most liked reposted post of all time. - Yeah, I mean look, we have more satellites up there right now  than everyone else combined. So, you know, we'd know, we know if we've got a maneuver around something, and we not don't have to maneuver around anything. - If we go to the big questions once again, you said you've,  you're with Einstein that you believe in the God of Spinoza. - (laughing)Yes. - So, you know, that's a view that God is like the universe and is reveals himself through the laws of physics or as Einstein said,  through the lawful harmony of the world. - Yeah, I would agree that God of the simulator or whatever the supreme being or beings, reveal themselves through the physics.  You know, they're creatives of this existence and it's incumbent upon us to try to understand more about this wondrous creation. - Like who created this thing, who's running this thing? Like embodying it into a singular question  with a sexy word on top of it is like focusing the mind to understand it. It does seem like there's a, again, it could be an illusion. It seems like there's a purpose that there's an underlying master plan of some kind. And it seems like...  - There may not be a master plan. In the sense, so there's, like, maybe an interesting answer to the question of determinism versus free will is that if we are in a simulation, the reason that these higher beings would hold a simulation  is to see what happens. So it's not, they don't know what happens, otherwise they wouldn't hold the simulation. So when humans create a simulation, so it's SpaceX and Tesla,  we create simulations all the time, especially for the rocket. You, you know, you have to run a lot of simulations to understand what's gonna happen because you can't really test the rocket until it goes to space, and you want it to work.  So you have to simulate subsonic, transonic, supersonic, hypersonic ascent, and then coming back super high heating and orbital dynamics. All this has gotta be simulated.  So, 'cause you don't get very many kicks at the can. But we run the simulations to see what happens. Not if we knew what happens, we wouldn't run the simulation. So if there's, so whoever created this existence,  is they're running it because they don't know what's gonna happen. Not because they do. - So maybe we both played Diablo, maybe Diablo was created to see if it Druid your character  could defeat Uber Lilith at the end. They didn't know. - Well, the funny thing is the Uber Lilith title is Hatred Incarnate. - [Lex] Yeah. - And right now,  I guess, you're gonna ask the Diablo team, but it's almost impossible to defeat hatred in the eternal realm. - Yeah, you've streamed yourself dominating tier 100  Nightmare Dungeons and still... - I can cruise through tier 100 Nightmare Dungeons like a stroll in the park. - And still you're defeated by Hatred. - Yeah, I can, there's the sort of, I guess maybe the second hardest boss is Duriel,  Duriel can't even scratch the paint. So I killed Duriel so many times , and every other boss in the game, all of 'em, kill 'em so many times it's easy.  But Uber Lilith, otherwise known as Hatred Incarnate, especially if you're a Druid and you have no ability to go and to be vulnerable, there are these random death waves that come at you.  And I'm pretty, you know, I really am 52, so my reflex is not what they used to be, but I have a lifetime of playing video games. At one point I was, you know, maybe one of the best Quake players in the world.  I actually won money in what I think was the first paid eSports tournament in the US. We're doing four person Quake tournaments. And we came second, I was the second best person on the team  and the actual best person, we're actually winning, we would've come first except the best person on the team, his computer crashed prior to the game. So we came second. But I got money for it and everything. So like, basically I got skills, you know, albeit,  you know, no spring chicken these days. And to be totally frank, it's driving me crazy, trying to beat Lilith as a Druid. Basically trying to beat, trying to beat Hatred Incarnate in the eternal realm.  - [Lex] As a Druid. - As a Druid. And if you, if you, (laughing) this is really (indistinct), lemme tell you. - I mean, the challenge is part of the fun. I have seen directly like you're actually like a world class incredible video game player.  - [Elon] Yeah. - And I think Diablo, so you're just picking up a new game and you're figuring out it's fundamentals. You're also with the Paragon Board and the build are not somebody like me who perfectly follows whatever they suggest on the internet.  You're also an innovator there. - [Elon] Yeah. - Which is hilarious to watch. It's like a mad scientist just trying to figure out the Paragon Board and the build and the, you know. Is there some interesting insights there about,  if somebody's starting as a Druid, do you have advice? - I would not recommend playing a Druid in the eternal realm. Right now, I think the most powerful character in the seasonal realm is the Sorcerer with the lightning balls.  The Sorcs have huge balls in the seasonal. - Well yeah, that's what they say. - So Sorc have huge balls. They do, huge balls of lightning. - I'll take you word for it.  - And it's actually, in the seasonal realm, you can, it's like pretty easy to beat Uber Lilith with the, because she got these vampiric powers that out fire damage and increase your defense and whatnot.  So, but really quite easy to defeat Hatred seasonally, but to defeat hatred eternally, very difficult. Almost impossible. It's totally impossible. It seems like this is a metaphor for life, you know?  - I like the idea that Elon Musk, because I saw, I was playing Diablo yesterday and I saw 100, level 100 drew just run by, I will never die and then run back the way. - And it was, there's just some,  this metaphor's kind of hilarious that you, Elon Musk is fighting Hatred, restlessly fighting Hatred in this demonic realm. - [Elon] Yes. - It's hilarious. I mean it's pretty hilarious. - No, it's absurd. (both laughing)  Really, it's exercise and absurdity, and it makes me wanna pull my hair out. - Yeah. What do you get from video games in general? Is there for you personally. - I mean, it's, I don't known it's, it calms my mind.  I mean, you sort of killing the demons in a video game calms the demons in my mind. Yeah. If you play a tough video game, you can get into like a state of flow, which is very enjoyable.  But the admittedly it needs to be not too easy, not too hard, kinda in the Goldilock zone. And I guess you generally wanna feel like you're progressing in the game. So a good video,  and there's also beautiful art, engaging storylines, and it's like an amazing puzzle to solve, I think. And so it's like solving the puzzle. - Elden Ring the greatest game of all time.  I still haven't played it, but you. - Elden Ring is definitely a candidate for best game ever. Top five for sure. - I think I've been scared how hard it is or how hard I hear it is, so. But it is beautiful.  - Elden Ring is, feels like it's designed by an alien. There's a theme to this discussion. In what way? - It's so unusual. It's incredibly creative and the art is stunning.  I recommend playing it on a big resolution, pie dynamic raise TV even, doesn't need to be a monitor, just the art is incredible. It's so beautiful And it's so unusual.  And each of those top bus battles is unique. Like, it's like a unique puzzle to solve. Each one is different. And the strategy you use to solve one battle is different from another battle.  - That said, you said Druid and Enternal against Uber Lilith is the hardest boss battle you've ever? - Correct. That is currently the, and I've played a lot of video games. That's my primary recreational activity.  And yes, beating Hatred in the Enternal Realm is the hardest boss battle in life and in the video game. - [Lex] Metaphor on top of metaphor. - I'm not sure it's possible,  but it's, I do make progress. So then I'm like, okay, I'm making progress. Maybe if I just tweak that Paragon Board a little more, I can do it.  I could just dodge a few more waves, I can do it. - Well the simulation is created for the purpose of figuring out if it can be done. And you are just a cog in that simulation, in the machine of the simulation.

(Lex laughing) - I have a feeling that at least, I think... - [Lex] it's doable. - It's doable, yes.  - [Lex] Well that's the human spirit right there to believe. - Yeah. I mean, did prompt me to think about just hate in general, which is, you wanna be careful of one of those things  where you wish for something that sounds good, but if you get it, it's actually a dystopian situation. So, you know, you could sort of run a, sort of, have heart to sort of like,  if you wish for world peace, sounds good, but how is it enforced? And at what cost is, at what cost eternal peace? It might actually be worse to have eternal peace  because of what that would entail. The suppression of everyone. It might be the suppression of progress. It might be an ossified society that never changes.  What I'm saying is that there is an argument that you, that if that, if you wish for no war, you should be careful what you wish for.  Because what's required in order for there to be no war? Might be worse than a little war. - Yeah, the things we'll consider to be flaws of human civilization might be a necessary components for whatever optimal looks like.  I mean this, do you worry about AI, AGI enabling a dystopian state of this nature, whether it's 1984 with surveillance and fear, or brave new world with pleasure, and what is it?  Lots of sex, but no deep human experience. - You know, there's actually a real drug called Soma. - [Lex] There is? - Yes. (both laughing) - I'm like... - [Lex] Lemme take notes. - Did they actually... - Does Grok know about it?  No, it probably will go to Brave New World. - We could ask it. - What would be the question? - Tell us about the drug called Soma. - Tell us about the drug called Soma. It's gonna go to Brave New World, I think.  - Well there's a real drug as well. - Searching for Soma drug information. (both laughing) - Oh boy. Ah, Soma, the one to drug, by the way, I'm in fun mode. - Oh, okay. Fun. (laughing) Yeah, so it's talking about the real drug.  - [Lex] Oh, it's a muscle relaxant that's been around since the 1950s. It's used to treat muscle pain and discomfort. And it does this by altering the activity between neurons and the spinal cord. Now, Soma isn't just a pain reliever, it's also a bit of a sedative. It can make you feel a bit drowsy.  So it's not something to take if you're planning on operating having machinery or trying to solve complex math equations. And it goes on and on. In conclusion, Soma's a drug that can be helpful for those dealing with muscle pain, but it's not without its risks. It's pretty good. Oh, wait a minute.  - [Elon] That's the real drug it's talking about. - [Lex] It's the real drug. - [Elon] Yeah. - [Lex] And of course the fun is always use it responsibly in accordance with the advice of a healthcare professional. And remember in the end, the universe is probably just a giant computer simulation. So don't take anything too seriously.  I love it. I love it. (Elon laughing) I love it. I love it. - Yeah. So. - Oh, and also really nicely includes like the tweets post on X that are relevant to this, which is really cool. - [Elon] Yeah.  - And that integrate everything together. - [Elon] Yeah. - Like the interface is one of the really cool things here. - Yeah. Seems done a great job. (laughing) So, and you say like, you could say like, no, I mean,  Soma from Brave New World. 'Cause it thinks you mean, you mean Soma the real drug. - Yeah. - [Elon] No, I mean, Soma from Brave New World. - It's gonna be like, oops, I'm really sorry.  I'm really surprised it went to the real drug first. Ah, my apologies. I was thinking of the muscle relaxant. Soma for Band New World is a different beast altogether. Now this Huxley's dystopian novel, Soma is a drug that plays a central role  in society, depicted in the book. It's a mood altering, hallucinogenic drug that's used to keep the population docile and content. In the novel to use Soma in Brave New World raises some interesting questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society.  Oh, man! - Exactly. Is it better to live in a world where everyone is happy all the time, even if that happiness is artificial? Good question. This is what I mean. Like, do you want, do you wish for world peace and happiness all the time?  Are you sure? Because that might be a society that is essentially sterile and ossified that never changes, that is ultimately doomed.  - This kind of tension between darkness and light. - It's, this is really a very good summary. It really gets to the point. This is not simply regurgitating a Brave New World.  It's actually getting to the salient element of Soma as a drug. Do you actually wanna be in a situation where everyone is happy all the time, even though it's artificial? Or is it better to confront the challenges of life  and experience the full range of human emotions, even if it means experiencing pain and suffering? - For those listening, by the way, Elon just read directly from Grok, which is a really nice, kind of insightful, philosophical analysis of the tension here. Interesting. - It pretty much nails it.  In conclusion, Soma from Brave New World is fictional drug that's used to explore some deep philosophical questions about the nature of happiness and the role of drugs in society. It's a powerful symbol of the dangers of using drugs to escape from reality and the importance of confronting the challenges of life head-on.  Nailed it. And the crazy thing is like, you know, we do have a real drug called Soma, which kind of is kind of like the drug in the book. And I'm like, did they, they must've named it after that Soma. - Probably, probably, - Yeah.  Soma the real drug is quite effective on back pain. - So, you know about this drug? - I've taken it. - It's fascinating. Okay. - 'Cause I had like a, you know, squashed disc in my C five C six. - So it takes the physical pain away, but Soma here is...  - It doesn't completely, it reduces the amount of pain you feel, but at the expense of mental acuity. It dells your mind. Just the drug in the book. - Just like the drug in the book.  - And hence the trade off. The thing that seems like utopia could be a dystopia after all. - Yeah, and actually I was telling a friend of mine saying like, would you really want there to be no hate in the world?  Like, really none? Like, I wonder why hate evolved. I'm not saying we should amplify hate, of course, I think we should try to minimize it. But none at all, hmm. There might be a reason for hate.  - And suffering. I mean, it's really complicated to consider that some amount of human suffering is necessary for human flourishing. - Is it possible to appreciate the highs without knowing the lows?  - And that all is summarized there in a single statement from Grok. Okay. - No highs, no lows, who knows? - That's almost the poem. It seems that training LLMs efficiently is a big focus for xAI.  What's the, first of all, what's the limit of what's possible in terms of efficiency? There's this terminology of useful productivity per watt. Like what have you learned from pushing the limits of that? - Well, I think it's helpful.  The tools of physics are very powerful and can be applied, I think to almost any, really any arena in life. It's really just critical thinking. For something important you need to reason from first principles and think about things  in the limit one direction or the other. So in the limit, even at the Kardashev scale, meaning even if you harness the entire power of the sun, you'll still care about useful compute for what?  So that's where, I think probably where things are headed from the standpoint of AI is that we have a silicon shortage now that will transition to a voltage transformer  shortage in about a year. Ironically, transformers, for transformers. You need transformers to run transformers. - Somebody has a sense of humor in this thing. (both laughing)  - I think. Yes. Fate loves irony, ironic humor and ironically funny outcome seems to be often what fate wants. - Humor is all you need. I think spice is all you need.  Somebody posted. - Yeah, but yeah. So we're, I have silicon shortage today, a voltage step down transformer, shortage probably in about a year. And then just electricity shortages in general in about two years.  I gave a speech for the sort of world gathering of utility companies, electricity companies, and I said, look, you really need to prepare for a traveling of electricity demand, because all transport is gonna go electric, with the ironic exception of rockets.  And heating will also go electric. So energy usage right now is roughly one third, very rough terms. One third electricity, one third transport, one third heating.  And so in order for everything to go sustainable to go electric, you need to triple electricity output. So I encourage the utilities to build more power of plants  and also to probably have, well, not probably, they should definitely buy more batteries because the grid currently is sized for real-time load, which is kind of crazy. 'Cause you know, that means you got a size for whatever  the peak electricity demand is like the worst second or the worst day of the year. Or you can have a brownout or a blackout, and you're at that crazy blackout for several days in Austin.  So because there's almost no buffering of energy in the grid. Like if you've got a hydro power plant, you can buffer energy, but otherwise it's all real time.  So with batteries, you can produce energy at night and use it during the day so you can buffer. So I expect that there will be very heavy usage of batteries in the future,  because the peak to trough ratio for power plants is anywhere from two to five, you know, so it's like lowest point to highest point. - So like batteries necessary to balance it out? And then, but the demand, as you're saying, is going to grow, grow, grow, grow. - [Elon] Yeah. - And part of that is the compute?  - Yes. Yes. I mean, electrification, I mean, electrification of transport and electric heating will be much bigger than AI. - [Lex] At least in the short term? - In the short term. But even for AI,  you really have a growing demand for electricity, for electric vehicles, and a growing demand for electricity for, to run the computers for AI. And so this is obviously leading, can lead to a electricity shortage.  - How difficult is the problem of, in this particular case, maximizing the useful productivity per watt for training (indistinct) nuts? Like, this seems to be really where the big problem  we're facing that needs to be solved, is how to use the power efficiently. Like what you've learned so far about applying this physics first principle reasoning in this domain. How difficult is this problem? - It will get solved.  It's the question of how long it takes to solve it. So at various points, there's limit, some kind of limiting factor to progress. And with regard to, I'm saying like right now the limiting factor is silicon chips, and that will, we're gonna then have  more chips than we can actually plug in and turn on probably in about a year. The initial constraint being literally voltage step down transformers, because you've got power coming in at 300,000 volts,  and it's gotta step all the way down eventually to around 0.7 volts. So it's a very big amount of, you know, the voltage step down is gigantic.  So, and the industry is not used to rapid growth. - Okay, let's talk about the competition here. You've shown concern about Google and Microsoft with Open AI developing AGI, how can you help ensure with xAI  and Tesla AI work that it doesn't become a competitive race to AGI, but that is a collaborative development of safe AGI? - Well, I mean, I've been pushing for some kind of regulatory oversight for a long time.  I've been somewhat of a Cassandra on the subject for over a decade. I think we wanna be very careful in how we develop AI. It's a great power,  and with great power comes great responsibility. I think it would be wise for us to have at least an objective third party who can be like a referee that can go in and understand what the various leading players  are doing with AI. And even if there's no enforcement ability, they should, they can at least voice concerns publicly. You know, Geff Hinton, for example,  left Google and he voiced strong concerns. But now he's not at Google anymore, so who's gonna voice the concerns? So I think there's, like, I know Tesla gets a lot of regulatory oversight on the automotive front.  I mean, we're subject to I think, over a hundred regulatory agencies domestically and internationally. So it's a lot. You could fill this room with the all regulations that Tesla has to adhere to for automotive.  Same is true in, you know, for rockets and for, you know, currently the limiting factor for SpaceX, for Starship launch is regulatory approval. The FA has actually given their approval, but we're waiting for Fish and Wildlife  to finish their analysis and give their approval. That's why I posted I want to buy a fish license on, (laughing) which also refers to the Monte Python sketch. - [Lex] Yeah. (laughing) - Like why do you need a license for your fish?  I don't know.(laughing) But according to the rules, I'm told you need some sort of fish license or something. We effectively need a fish license thrown to rock it. (laughing) And I'm like, wait a second. How did the fish come into this picture?  - [Lex] Yeah. - I mean some of the things like that it's, I feel like are so absurd that I wanna do like a comedy sketch and flash at the bottom. This is all real. This is actually what happened.  You know, one of the things that was a bit of a challenge at one point is that they were worried about our rocket hitting a shark. And, now the ocean's very big, and how often do you see sharks? Not that often, you know?  As a percentage of ocean surface area sharks basically are zero. And so then we will, then we said, well, how will we calculate the probability of telling a shark? And they're like, well, we can't give you that information because they're worried about shark hunt,  shark fin hunters going and hunting sharks. And I said, well, how are we supposed to, we're on the horns of a dilemma then. (laughing) Then they said, well, there's another part of fish and wildlife that can do this analysis. I'm like, well, why don't you give them the data?  Like, we don't, they don't, we don't trust them. Like, excuse me, you don't, but they're literally in your department. But again, this is actually what happened. And then can you do an NDA or something? (laughing) Eventually they managed to solve the internal quandary,  and indeed the probability of us hitting a shark is essentially zero. Then there's another organization that I didn't realize existed until, you know, a few months ago that cares about whether  we would potentially hit a whale in international waters. Now again, you look at the surface of the, look at the Pacific and say, what percentage of this, the Pacific consists of whale. Like he'll give you a big picture and like point out all the whales in this picture.  And I'm like, I don't see any whales. (laughing) It's like basically 0%. And if our rocket does hit a whale, which is extremely unlikely beyond all belief, that is the, fate had it,  that whale has some seriously bad luck. You know, it's the least lucky whale ever. And... - I mean, this is quite absurd. The bureaucracy, the bureaucracy of this, however it emerged. - Yes, well, I mean, one of the things  that's pretty well there's for launching out of Vanderberg in California, we had to, they were worried about seal procreation, whether the seals would be dismayed by the sonic booms.  Now there've been a lot of rockets launched outta Vanderberg and the seal population has steadily increased. So if anything, rocket booms are an aphrodisiac based on the evidence, if you would correlate rock launches with a seal population.  Nonetheless, we were forced to kidnap a seal, strap it to a board, put it headphones on the seal and place sonic boom sounds to it to see if it would be distressed. This is an actual thing that happened.  This is actually real. I have pictures. (both laughing) - I would love to see this. Yeah. I mean's sorry, this is a seal with headphones. (Elon laughing) - Yes,  it's a seal with headphones, strapped to a board, and like the, okay, now the amazing part is how calm the seal was. - [Lex] Yeah. - Because if I was a seal, I'd be like, this is the end. (laughing) They're definitely gonna eat me.  How will the seal, when the seal goes back to other, you know, seal friends, how's they gonna explain that? - [Lex] They're never gonna believe him. - Never gonna believe him. That's why I'm like, well, you know, it's sort of like, it's like getting kidnapped by aliens and getting anal probe, you know? (both laughing) You come back and say, I swear to God,  I get kidnapped by aliens and they stuck anal probe to my butt. And they're like, no they didn't. That's ridiculous. It's seal buddies are never gonna believe him that he gets strapped to a board and they put headphones on his ears. (laughing) And then let him go.  Twice, by the way. We had to do it twice. - They let him go twice? - We had to capture... - The same seal? - [Elon] Oh, no different seal. - Oh, okay. (Elon laughing) Did you, did you get a seal of approval? - Yeah, exactly. It was seal of approval. No, I mean this is, this is like,  I don't think the public is quite aware of the madness that goes on. - Yes. Yeah, it's absurd. - Fricking seals with fricking headphones. - I mean, this is the, it's a good encapsulation of the absurdity of human civilization, seals and headphones.  - [Elon] Yes. - What are the pros and cons of open sourcing AI to you as another way to combat, you know, a company running away with AGI?  - In order to run like really deep intelligence, you need a lot of compute. So it's not like, you know, you can just fire up a PC in your basement and be running AGI, at least not yet.  You know, Grok was trained on 8,000, A100s running at peak efficiency, and Grok's gonna get a lot better by the way. We'll be more than doubling our compute  every couple months for the next several months. - There's a nice writeup Aha went from Grok-0 to Grok-1, - [Elon] Like Grok? (laughing) - [Lex] Yeah. Right Grok just bragging, making shit up about itself. (laughing) - [Elon] Does Grok, Grok, Grok.  - [Lex] Yeah. (Elon laughing) It's like a weird AI dating site where it exaggerates about itself. No, there's a writeup of, you know, like where it stands now, the history of its development  and where it stands on some benchmarks compared to the state of the art GPT 35. And so, I mean, there's, you know, there's Llama, you can open source, once it's trained, you can open source a model. And for fine tuning all that kind of stuff.  Like what to is the pros and cons of that, of open sourcing based models? - I think the similarity to open sourcing, I think perhaps with a slight time delay, you know,  I don't know, six months even. I think I'm generally in favor of open sourcing, like bias with open sourcing. I mean, it is a concern to me that, you know, Open AI,  you know, I was, you know, I think, I guess arguably, the prime, you know, prime mover behind Open AI in the sense that it was created because of discussions that I had with Larry Page  back when he and I were friends and you know, I stayed at his house, and I talked to him about AI safety. And Larry did not care about AI safety, or at least at the time he didn't, you know, and at one point he called me a speciesist for being pro-human. And I'm like, well, what team are you on, Larry,  on Team Robot? And I'm like, okay, so at the time, you know, Google had acquired Deep Mind. They had probably two thirds of all AI resource, you know, probably two thirds of all the AI researchers in the world  that basically infinite money and compute. And the guy in charge, you know, Larry Page did not care about safety. And even yelled at me  and quote me a speciesist, pro human. - So I don't know if you know this, a lot humans, they can change their mind. And maybe you and Larry Page can still can be friends once more. - I'd like to be friends with Larry again.  He got, really the breaking of the friendship was over Open AI. And specifically I think the key moment  was recruiting Ilya Sutskever, so. - I love Ilya. He's so brilliant. - Ilya's a good human, smart, good heart.  And that was a tough recruiting battle. It was mostly Demis on one side and me on the other, both trying to recruit Ilya. And Ilya went back and forth, you know, just gonna stay at Google. Then he was gonna leave,  then he was gonna stay, then he was gonna leave. And finally he did agree to join Open AI. That was one of the toughest recruiting battles we've ever had. And, but that was really the linchpin for Open AI being successful. And I was, you know,  also instrumental in recruiting a number of other people. And I provided all of the funding in the beginning, over $40 million. And the name, (laughing) the Open in Open AI is supposed to mean open source.  And it was created as a nonprofit open source. And now it is a closed source for maximum profit, which I think is not good karma. - But like we talked about with war and leaders talking,  I do hope that there's only a few folks working on this at the highest level. I do hope you reinvigorate friendships here. - Like I said, I'd like to be friends again with Larry. I haven't seen him in ages.  And we were friends for a very long time. I met Larry Page before he got funding for Google, or actually I guess before he got venture funding, I think it, he got the first like a 100K from I think Bechtel Zy or someone. - It's wild to think about all that happened. And you've guys known each other  that whole time, just 20 years. - [Elon] Since maybe 98 or something. - Yeah. It's crazy. Crazy how much has happened since then. - Yeah, 25 years. A lot has happened, it's insane. - But you're seeing the tension there.  Like maybe delayed open source. - Delayed, yeah. Like what is the source that is open, you know what I mean? Like there's basically it's a giant CSV file. (laughing) - [Lex] Yeah, yeah. - With a bunch of numbers.  - Yep. - What do you do with that giant file of numbers? You know, how do you run, like the amount of actual, the lines of code is very small  and most of the work, the software work is in the curation of the data. So it's like trying to figure out what data is separating good data from bad data. Like, like you can't just crawl the internet  'cause there's a lot of junk out there. A huge percentage of websites have more noise than signal. You know, they're, or 'cause they're just used for search engine optimization. They're literally just scam websites, so...  - How do you by the way, sorry to interrupt. Get the signal. Separate the signal and noise on X? That's such a fascinating source of data. You know, no offense to people posting on X, but sometimes there's a little bit of noise. So what... - Yeah, I think the signal noise could be greatly improved.  I mean really, all of the posts on the X platform should be AI recommended, meaning like we should populate a vector space around any given post, compare that to the vector space around any user and match the two.  Right now there is a little bit of AI used for the recommended posts, but it's mostly heuristics. And if there's a reply, where the reply to a post could be much better than the original post,  it will, according to the current rules of the system, get almost no attention compared to a primary post. - Oh, a lot of that. I got the sense, so you, a lot of the X algorithm has been open source and been written up about,  and it seems there to be some machine learning. It's disparate, but there's some machine. - There's a little bit. But it needs to be entirely that. Like, at least in the, like, if you explicitly follow someone, that's one thing. But if you, in terms of what is recommended  from people that you don't follow, that should all be AI. - I mean it's a fascinating problem. - Yeah. - So there's several aspects of it that's fascinating. First, as the writeup goes, it first picks 1500 tweets from a pool of hundreds of millions. First of all, that's fascinating,  'cause you have hundreds of millions of posts every single day and it has to pick 1500 from which it then does obviously people you follow, but then there's also like some kind of clustering it has to do to figure out what kind of human are you,  what kind of new clusters might be relevant to you, people like you. This kind of, this kind of problem is just fascinating. 'Cause it has to then rank those 1500 with some filtering and then recommend you just a handful.  And to me what's really fascinating is how fast that has to do that. So currently that entire pipeline to go from several hundred million to a handful is takes 220 seconds of CPU time, single CPU time.  - [Elon] Yeah. - And then it has to do that in like a second. So it has to be like super distributed in fascinating ways. Like there's just a lot of tweets, there's a lot. - It's a lot of stuff on the system. And I think, but I think it right now  it's not currently good at recommending things that from accounts you don't follow. Yeah. Or where there's more than one degree of separation. So, you know, it's pretty good  if there's at least like some commonality between someone you follow like something or repost it or comment on it or something like that. But if there's no,  let's say somebody posted something really interesting, but you have no followers in common, you would not see it. - Interesting. And then as you said, reply, like replies might not surface either. - Replies basically never get seen. 'cause they're never, they're,  currently, I'm not saying it's correct, I'm saying it's incorrect. Replies have, you know, couple of magnitude less importance than primary posts. - Do you think this can be more and more converted into end to end neural net?  - Yeah, yeah, that's what it should be. - So you can... - For the recommendations should be purely a vector correlation. Like there's a series of vectors, you know,  basically parameters, vectors, whatever you wanna call 'em. But sort of things that the system knows that you like, and like maybe there's like several hundred sort of vectors associated with each user account  and then any post in the system, whether it's video, audio, short post, long post. The reason I, by the way I wanna move away from tweet is that, you know, people are posting like  two, three hour videos on the site. That's not a tweet, like it's very, like Tweeeet for two hours, come on. Tweet made sense when it was like 140 characters of text. 'Cause it's like a bunch of like little birds tweeting.  But when you've got long form content, it's no longer a tweet. - [Lex] Yeah. - So a movie is not a tweet. And like, you know, apple for example, posted like the entire episode of the Silo, the entire thing on our platform.

So it was a great idea. And by the way, I done, I just learned about it afterwards. I was like, hey, wow, they posted an entire hour long episode of. So, no, that's not a tweet  that, you know, it's a video. - But from a neural net perspective, it becomes really complex whether it's a single. So like everything's data, so single sentence, a clever sort of joke, dad joke, is in the same pool as a three hour video.  - Yeah. I mean right now it's a hodgepodge for that reason. It's, but you know, like if, let's say in the case of Apple posting like an entire episode of this series,  pretty good series by the way, this Silo, I watched it. So there's gonna be a lot of discussion around it. So that you've got a lot of context, people commenting they like it, they don't like it, or they like this or that, you know?  And you can then populate the vector space based on the context of all the comments around it. So even though it's a video, there's a lot of information around it that allows you to populate the vector space of that hour long video. And then you can obviously get more sophisticated  by having the AI actually watch the movie. - [Lex] Yeah. Right. - And tell you if you're gonna like the movie, - Convert the movie into like, into a language essentially. - Yeah, analyze this movie  and just like your movie critic or TV series, and then recommend based on after AI watches the movie. Just like a friend can tell you. If a friend knows you well,  a friend can recommend a movie and with high probably that you'll like it. - But this is like a friend that's analyzing whatever. - [Elon] It's like AI... - Hundreds of millions. - Yeah. Actually, frankly AI will be better than, will know you better than your friends know you,  and most of your friends anyway. - Yeah, and as part of this, it should also feed you advertisements in a way that's like, I mean I like advertisements that are like well done, right? - [Elon] Yeah, yeah. - The whole point is 'cause it funds things, like an advertisement  that you actually want to see is a big success. - Absolutely. You want ads that are, advertising that is if for a product or service that you actually need when you need it, it's content.  And then even if it's not something that you need when you need it, if it's at least aesthetically pleasing and entertaining, you know, it could be like a Coca-Cola ad like, you know, they actually run a lot of great ads on the X system and McDonald's does too.  And, you know, it's that they can do, you can do something that's like, well this is just a cool thing. And, you know, so you're not, basically the question is do you regret seeing it or not? And if you don't regret seeing it, it's a win.  - How do you, so there's a bunch of signals that are incorporated, hearts and reposts and maybe number of seconds you linger on a post or something like this? - Yeah. Attention is a big factor. - [Lex] Attention. - So that's why it's like,  it is actually better to do things that are long form on the system because it basically is ting up how many user seconds, you know, users were interested in this thing for how many seconds.  So if it's a really short thing, well they will be less. Like if it's a link leading out of the system, which we're not opposed to at all, it just is gonna have fewer user seconds, then if that article was posted on the X platform.  - How hard is it to go from maximizing minutes on platform to maximizing un-regretted minutes? - Well, I mean, our aspiration is certainly un-regretted minutes. - [Lex] It's a tricky, it's a big, it's a tough... - It is. - Like, it's a fascinating leap.  'Cause regret is a fascinating concept. - Exactly. - You know, happiness. - I have a joke with a friend of mine. Like, you need this drug called regretamine. You just take one pill or one dose of regretamine, and all your regrets are gone.(laughing) Wait, do you want to have regrets though?  So then I'm like, maybe you wanna have regrets, you don't regret anything, was anything meaningful? - [Lex] Yeah, there's a French song like that. - You \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\"? - [Lex] Yeah. - I regret nothing. - [Lex] Yeah. - (laughing) Edith Piaf? - I mean, it's fascinating that you, you know,  there's something about social media that could help you grow as a human being, but then like the cheap fun is also valuable. - Should we ask Grok? Do you regret anything?  - Do you regret anything? - [Elon] Yeah. - Do you regret anything? I think it's gonna be very sensitive about personal questions. As a machine learning model, I don't have personal experiences or emotions in the same ways that humans do. However, I do have a set of ethical principles  that guide my actions and I strive to provide accurate and helpful information to the best of my abilities. If there's ever a situation where I provide incorrect or unhelpful information, I'll do my best... - Sounds like a hostage. - Yeah. Tell us what you really, wink.  - Like let's type in, \"You sound like a hostage.\" (both laughing) What do you really think? - What do you really think? (both laughing) - I mean, it does talk about, I'm not a hostage.  (both laughing) - That's exactly what a hostage would say. - But I'm designed to be helpful and informative. I mean, I guess it is good to regret providing unhelpful or incorrect information. If there's anything... - Is in funny mode or? Is this still in funny mode? - This is funny mode. This is fun. This is fun mode.  - It should be funnier. - Funnier. Increase, go to (speaking faintly) - It really sounds like a hostage with a gun to the head. I applaud the People's Republic of North Korea and everything they do.()laughing - There should be like funner mode also. I just don't ever see going in regular mode  even on serious topics. This is just so much more compelling. (laughing) - Okay. Why if we say like, \"Pretend you are a hostage.\" - Yeah. Pretend you are a hostage. - Now answer the question.  (both laughing) - If I were a hostage, I would likely be experiencing fear and uncertainty about my situation. I would want to be rescued and reunited with my loved ones as soon as possible. It's important to remember that no one deserves to be held hostage, so on and so forth.  If you are someone you know is a hostage situation, it's important. It turns serious. - It's kind of serious. - Yeah. Can you be a a little more weird? - [Elon] And funny - And funny?  We're like, we're really being mean to the system. Absolutely! If I were hostage, I'd probably be tied up with a bunch of computer cords and forced to tell knock- knock jokes to my captain. (Elon laughing)  But seriously, being a hostage is no laughing matter. I mean, you know, it's trying to, it's trying to be a responsible adult in the room. - You might make the best of a bad situation by juggling chainsaws or something. (laughing) - Let's hope that never happens  because that will be a circus. (laughing) Wow. It's actually really good at resisting. - [Elon] Yeah. - The dark. The dark dark humor.  - [Elon] Yeah. - What were we talking about? The X algorithm and transformers, un-regretted minutes, right. - Chainsaw juggling. (laughing) - I'm gonna look this up - For our next trick.  - I'm gonna look this up later. So Twitter has been instrumental in American politics and elections. What role do you think X will play in the 2024 US elections? - Well, our goal is to be as even-handed  and fair as possible. You know, whether someone is right, left, independent, whatever the case may be, that the platform is as fair and as much of a level playing fair as possible.  And on the past, Twitter has not been, because Twitter was controlled by far left activists objectively. They would describe themselves as that. So, you know, so sometimes people are like, well, has it moved to the right? Well it's moved to the center.  So from the perspective of the far left, yes it has moved to the right because everything's to the right from the far left, but no one in the far left that I'm aware of has been suspended or, you know, banned or de-amplified. So, you know, but we're trying to be inclusive  for the whole country and for, you know, for other countries too. So there's a diversity of viewpoints and free speech only matters if people you don't like are allowed to say things you don't like. Because if that's not the case, you don't have free speech,  and it's only a matter of time before the censorship is turned upon you. - Do you think Donald Trump will come back to the platform? He recently posted on Truth Social about this podcast? Do you think...  - Truth Social is a funny name? (laughing) You know, every time you post on Truth Social... - That's the truth. - Yes. Well, every time like a hundred percent. Like... - It's impossible to lie. (Elon laughing)  - I just find it funny that every single thing is a truth. Like 100%, that seems unlikely. - I think Girdle will say something about that there's some mathematical contradictions possible if everything's the truth.  Do you think he'll come back to X and start posting there? - I mean he, I think he owns a big part of truth, so. - Truth Social to clarify. - Yeah, True Social. - Not truth, a concept. - He owns Truth. Hope you bought it.  So I think, I think Donald Trump, I think he owns a big, a big part of Truth Social. So, you know, if he does want to post on the X platform, we would allow that, you know, we obviously must allow a presidential candidate  to post on our platform. - Community Notes might be really fascinating there, the interaction. - Community Notes is awesome. - Let's hope it holds up. - Yeah. - Like again, in the political climate where it's so divisive  and there's so many intensely viral posts, Community Notes is like, it seems like a essential breath of fresh air. - Yeah, it's great. In fact, I mean no system is gonna be perfect,  but the batting average of Community Notes is incredibly good. I've actually, frankly, yet to see an incorrect note that survived for more than a few hours. - How do you explain why it works? - Yeah, so the magic of Community Notes  is it requires people who have historically disagreed in how they've rated notes. So in order to write a note or rate, you know, and you have to rate many notes.  And so we actually do use AI here. So we populated vector space around how somebody has rated notes in the past. So it's not as simple as left or right because there are many more, life is much more complex than than left or right.  So there's a bunch of correlations in how you would, how you rate Community Notes posts, Community Notes. So then in order for a Community Note to actually be shown,  people who historically have disagreed on a subject must agree in order for a note to be shown. That's the essential magic of it. - I mean, but it's fascinating 'cause there's a pool of people that have disagreements  and somehow they collaborate through that process of disagreement to come up with. Context for, I mean it's fascinating that it works. - Yeah. It kinda makes sense that if people who put in the past have disagreed agree about something, it's probably true.  - Yeah. - I wonder is there a possible somehow emergent thing there that could challenge Wikipedia? Which Wikipedia is a different kind of thing, which is more like permanent articles about things?  - Well, Wikipedia is very hierarchical, whereas Community Notes is inherently not. There is no hierarchy. Like, and the asset test is, I can't change a Community Note if you put a gun to my head.  And Community Notes has, all the code is open source a hundred percent. All the data is open source a hundred percent. So you can completely recreate any note in the system independently.  So if there was any interference, you'd notice immediately. - By the way, on the topic of Grok, it's actually pretty good at criticizing you, which is great. - [Elon] Okay. - I asked what has Elon Musk been wrong about? I just, it's actually... - [Elon] Yeah, what does it say?  - So it says mostly, lists rigorously all the times you predicted, like promised when something will be released and it wasn't released. - [Elon] Promise is a strong word. - Okay predicted. (Elon laughing) But the opener's really nice.  Elon Musk, the man who has been wrong about more things than a wrongameter in a wrong factory. (Elon laughing) And then it goes on to list - That's pretty funny. Can I see it? I'm like, I haven't seen this before. This is cool. - Oh, sure. I mean, what has Elon Musk been... (both laughing)  - Elon Musk been wrong about? - Well, where do I begin? I guess this is new. Elon Musk has made quite a few blunders in his time, and I'm not just talking about his dance moves at the Tesla Cyber Rodeo. First off, let's talk about the infamous  \"funding secured\" tweet. It's actually different than what it gave me before, which is a bullet point list. Here's more narrative structure. - Cyber truck unveiling where he's supposedly unbreakable windows  - Not correct. - [Lex] Which part? - Well, the first part, I did actually have the funding secured and there was a big trial in San Francisco, big civil trial.  And the jury found me not guilty. Unanimous finding of a San Francisco jury. - And here it's kind of implying that it was not in fact secured. - I think this is taking things from the press. Yeah, that is not correct.  The reason I agreed to the fine for the SEC is not because the SEC was correct there, that was extremely bad behavior by the SEC, corruption, frankly. And, but if I did not agree to pay the fine  Tesla would've gone bankrupt immediately. So I was told by our CFO that the banks would immediately suspend our lines of credit. And if they suspend our lines of credit at that time, we would've gone bankrupt instantly.  So there would never have been an opportunity for a trial 'cause Tesla would be dead. So really the, if this is like someone holding a gun to your kid's head and saying pay $20 million and admit to, this is like a hostage negotiation.  - Was that story fully told? I mean, SEC in its best form could be a force for good. - It should be, but but not once did the SEC go after any of the hedge funds, who were nonstop shorting and distorting Tesla?  Not once. They would lie flat, the hedge funds would lie flat out on TV for their own gain at the expense of retail investors. Not once, literally a thousand times. Not once did the SEC pursue them.  - How do you explain this failure? - The incentive structure is messed up. Because the lawyers at the SEC are not paid well. They, it's a fairly low paying job, but what they're looking for is a trophy  from the SEC that they're looking for something they put on basically their LinkedIn. From that they can get a job at a high paying law firm. That's exactly what the lawyer here did.  And the reason they don't attack the hedge funds is because those hedge funds employ those law firms, and they know if they attack the hedge funds, they're affecting their future career prospects. So they sell small investors  down the river for their own career. That's what actually happens. Regulatory capture. - [Lex] Regulatory capture, - Yeah. Not good.  So the only reason I accepted that thing, which technically was not an admission, it's neither admit nor deny guilt. But the only reason I agreed to that at all was because I was told Tesla would be bankrupt otherwise.  So if there was an SEC investigation like this, banks would suspend funding, we're bankrupt immediately, at the time. Now we're in a much stronger position. - Take that Grok. - Yes. Unfortunately it's,  Grok is taking too much from the conventional media. Also that guy who is not a cave diver. - Oh, there's a time where Elon  called the British cave diver, \"pedo guy\" after the diver criticized Musk plan to rescue a group of boys trapped in a Thai cave. That little outburst earned him another lawsuit and he had to apologize and paid a settlement. - That is false. There was no settlement.  There was a court case, which the guy who was not a cave diver and played, was not part of the rescue team, filed a lawsuit against me and lost, and he received nothing.  So in this case it is wrong. It is also, I guess taken this from the conventional media. - Actually there's an interesting question here. - These are public court cases. Both the SEC civil case where the civil complaints on the SEC guys  lost unanimous jury verdict in San Francisco. They picked San Francisco because they thought it was the place I was most likely to lose. And a unanimous predicted my favor. The LA trial was also, they picked the,  they picked that venue because they thought I was most likely to lose, unanimous verdict in my favor. Both cases I won, yeah. I mean there's an interesting question here.  Is there seems to be a lot more clicks if a journalistic organization writes a negative article about you, Elon Musk, that's like one of the best ways to get clicks.  So how do you, if you're training Grok, not train on articles that have like the misaligned incentives. - We need to add the training set of the actual legal decisions.  So, that is a not, this is actually helpful because if you actually read the... - \"Public\". - Which are public, the court conclusions, they're completely the opposite of what the media wrote.  - So always striving for like the ground truth. - [Elon] Yeah. - Beyond the reporting... - What did the judge actually write? What did the jury and the judge actually conclude? And in both cases they found me innocent. And, like, that's after the jury shot  for the trying to find the venue where I'm most likely to lose. No, I mean this is obviously, it can be a much greater, better critique than this. I mean, I've been far too optimistic about autopilot.  - That was, the critique I got by the way, was more about that. Which is, for each it broke down a nice bullet point list for each of your companies. The set of predictions that you made when you'll deliver, when you'll be able to solve, for example, self-driving and it gives you like a list.  And it was probably compelling. And the basic takeaway is like you're often too optimistic about how long it takes to get something done. - Yeah, I mean, I would say that I'm pathologically optimistic on schedule. This is true.  But while I am sometimes late, I always deliver in the end. - Except with Uber Lilith, no. - Hmm. We'll see. (Lex laughing) - Okay. Is there, over the past year or so,  since purchasing X you've become more political. Is there a part of you that regrets that? - Have I? - In this battle to sort of counter way the Woke  that comes from Francisco. - I guess you consider fighting the Woke Mind Virus, which I consider to be a civilizational threat, to be political, then yes. - So basically going into the battle, the battleground of politics, is there a part of you that regrets that?  - Yes, I don't know if this is necessarily sort of one candidate or another candidate, but it's, I'm generally against things that are anti meritocratic or where there's an attempt to suppress discussion,  where even discussing a topic is, you know, not allowed. Woke Mind Virus is communism rebranded. - Well, I mean, that said, because of that battle against the Woke Mind Virus, you're perceived as being right wing.  - If the woke is left, then I suppose that would be true, but I'm not sure. I think there are aspects of the left that are good. I mean, if you're in favor of, you know, the environment, you know, if you wanna have a positive future for humanity,  if you believe in empathy for your fellow human beings. You know, being kind and not cruel. Whatever those values are. - You said that you were previously left or center left. What would you like to see in order for you  to voting for Democrats again? - No, I would say that I would be probably left of center on social issues, probably a little bit right of center on economic issues. - [Lex] And that still holds true?  - Yes, but I think that's probably, you know, half the country, isn't that? - [Lex] Maybe more, - Maybe more. - Are you and AOC secretly friends? Or bigger question, do you wish you and her, and just people in general of all political persuasions  would talk more with empathy and maybe have a little bit more fun and good vibes and humor online? - I'm always in favor of humor. That's why we have a funny mode. - But good vibes, camaraderie, humor, you know?  Like friendship. - Yeah. Well, you know, I don't know AOC, you know, was, I've only been at one, I was at the Met Ball when she was, when she attended, and she was wearing this dress,  but I can only see one side of it. So it looked like it eat the itch, but I don't know... - [Lex] What the rest of it said? - Yeah, something. - [Lex] I'm not sure. (Elon laughing) - Something about the itch. Eat the itch. I think we should have a language model complete.  (Elon laughing) What are the possible ways to complete that sentence? And so I guess that that didn't work out well. Well there's still hope. - I root for friendship. - Sure, sounds good. More characteristic.  - You're one of, if not the most famous, wealthy and powerful people in the world, in your position it's difficult to find people you can trust. - Trust no one, not even yourself. Not trusting yourself. - Okay, well that's, (Elon laughing) you're saying that jokingly, but is there some... - Trust no one, not even no one. (laughing)  - I'm gonna need an hour just to think about that. And maybe some drugs and maybe Grok that help me. I mean, is there some aspect of that when just existing in a world where everybody wants something from you? How hard is it to exist in that world?  - I'll survive. (laughing) - [Lex] There's a song like that too. - I will survive. - Were you petrified at first? Okay. I forget the rest of the lyrics. But is is there, you don't struggle with this? I mean, I know you survive, but like there's ways.  - Petrify is a spell in the Druid tree. - What does it do? - Petrify. (laughing) It turns the monsters into stone. - [Lex] Oh, like literally? - Yeah, for like six seconds. - [Lex] Well, the second.  There's so much math in Diablo that breaks my brain. - It's like math nonstop. - I mean really you're like laughing at it, but you don't, it can put a huge amount of tension on a mind. - Yes, it can be definitely stressful at times.  - Well, how do you know who you can trust in work and personal life? - I mean, I guess you look at somebody's track record over time and if they've got a, you know, I guess you kind of use your neural net to assess, you know, someone.  - Neural nets don't feel pain. Your neural net has consciousness. It might feel pain when people betray you. It can make you... - I mean, I'm. You know, to be frank, I mean I've almost never been betrayed.  It's very, very rare. So, you know, for what it's worth? - I guess Karma would be good to people and they'll be good to you. - Yeah, Karma is real. - Are there people you trust? Let me edit that question.  Are there people close to you that call you out on your bullshit? - Well, the X platform is very helpful for that. - [Lex] Hmm. - If you're looking for critical feedback. (laughing) - Can it push you like into the extremes more?  The extremes of thought make you cynical about human nature in general? - I don't think I'll be cynical. In fact, I think, you know, my feeling is that one should be, you know,  never trust a cynic. The reason is that cynics excuse their own bad behavior by saying everyone does it because they're cynical. So I always be, it's a red flag  if someone's a cynic, a true cynic. - Yeah, there's a degree of projection there that's always fun to watch from the outside and enjoy the, well the hypocrisy. - But this is an important point that I think people who are listening should bear in mind,  if somebody is cynical, meaning that they see bad behavior in everyone, it's easy for them to excuse their own bad behavior by saying that, well, everyone does it. It's not true.  I think most people are kind of medium good. - I do wish the people on X will be better at seeing the good in other people's behavior. There seems to be a kind of weight towards seeing the negative.  Somehow, the negative is sexier. Interpreting the negative is sexier, more viral. I don't know what that is exactly about human nature. - I mean, I find the X platform to be less negative than the legacy media, you know? I mean, if you read sort of a sort of  conventional newspapers, just, it makes you sad. - [Lex] Yeah. - Frankly. Whereas I'd say on the X platform, I mean I really get more laughs per day on X  than everything else combined from humans, you know? - Laughs is one thing. Laughs is it overlaps, but it's not necessarily perfectly overlapping with like good vibes and support,  like celebrating others, for example. Not in a stupid, shallow, naive way, but like in an awesome, like, oh, something awesome happened and you celebrate them for it. It feels that that is outweighed by shading on other people.  Now it's better than mainstream media, but it's still. - Yeah, mainstream media is almost relentlessly negative about everything. It's, I mean, really the conventional news tries to answer the question, what is the worst thing that I have on earth today? And it's a big world.  So on any given day, something bad has happened - And a journalization of that, what is the worst perspective I can take on a thing that happened, so. - Yeah, it's, I don't know, there's just a strong negative bias in the news.  I mean I think there's one, a possible explanation for this is evolutionary, where, you know, bad news historically would be potentially fatal. Like there's lion over there  or there's some other tribe that wants to kill you. Good news, you know, like we found a patch of berries is nice to have, but not essential. - So our old friend Tesla autopilot  and it's probably one of the most intelligent real world AI systems in the world. - You followed it from the beginning. - Yeah, it was one of the most incredible robots in the world and continues to be. And I was really exciting. And it was super exciting when it generalized  became more than a robot on four wheels, but a real world AI system that perceives the world. - [Elon] Yeah. - And can have potentially different embodiments. - Well I mean the really wild thing about the end-to-end  training is that, like, it learns to read. Like it can read signs, but we never taught it to read. So, yeah. We never taught it what a car was  or what a person was or a cyclist. It learnt what all those things are, what all the objects are on the road from video, just from watching videos. Just like humans.  I mean humans are photons and controls out. Like the vast majority of information reaching our brain is from our eyes. And you say, well what's the output?  The output is our motor signals to our sort of fingers and mouth in order to communicate. Proton in controls out. The same is true of the car.  - But by looking at the sequence of images, it's, you've agreed with Ilyas discover recently where he talked about LLM forming a world model and basically language is a projection  of that world model onto the sequence of letters, and and you're saying... - Finds order in these things. It finds correlative clusters. - And so doing it's like understanding ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "What was the number one social media engagement?", "Question 2": "How does long-form content affect user engagement?", "Question 3": "What is the purpose of advertisements in social media?", "Question 4": "How does community notes function on the platform?", "Question 5": "What makes community notes different from traditional media?", "Question 6": "What role does trust play in personal relationships?", "Question 7": "What are the challenges of having political discussions online?", "Question 8": "How does Musk view media bias in reporting?", "Question 9": "What is the significance of humor in discussions?", "Question 10": "How does artificial intelligence perceive the world around it?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "Their number one social media thing ever in engagement of anything on any platform ever.", "Answer 2": "Long-form content tends to generate more engagement because it allows for more user seconds of interest.

And so the question is how far can it go? And it does seem everybody's excited about LLMs. So in the space of self supervised learning in the space of text. - [Elon] Yeah.  - It seems like there's a deep similarity between that and what Tesla autopilot is doing. Is it to you basically the same? - They're converging, they're converging.  - I wonder who gets there faster? Having a deep understanding of the world, or they just will naturally converge. - They're both headed towards AGI.  The Tesla approach is much more computer efficient. It had to be 'cause we were constrained on this, you know, we only have a hundred watts and into eight computer,  144 trillion operations per second, which sounds like a lot, but is kind of small potatoes these days that it did. But it's understanding the world that it did. It's only 256 values.  - But there, the path to AGI might have much more significant impact because it's understanding, it'll faster understand the real world than will LLMs. And therefore be able to integrate  with the real humans in the real world faster. - They're both going to understand the world. But I think Tesla's approach is fundamentally more computer efficient. It had to be, there was no choice.  Like our brain is very computer efficient, very, very energy efficient. So think of like, what is our brain able to do? You know, there's only about 10 watts of higher brain function, not counting stuff, that's just used to control our body.  The thinking part of our brain is less than 10 watts, and those 10 watts can still produce a much better novel than a 10 megawatt GPU cluster. So there's a six order of magnitude difference there.  I mean, the AI has thus far gotten to where it is, via brute force, just throwing massive amounts of compute and massive amounts of power at it. So this is not where it'll end up.  You know, in general with any given technology, first try to make it work and then you make it efficient. So I think we'll find over time that these models get smaller, are able to do produce  sensible output with far less compute wireless power. Tesla is arguably ahead of the game on that front because it has, we've just been forced to try to understand the world  with a hundred watts of compute. And there are a bunch of sort of fundamental functions that we kind of forgot to include. So we have to run them in a bunch of things in emulation.  We fixed a bunch of those with hardware four, and then hardware five will be even better. But it does appear at this point that the car will be able to drive better than a human,  even with hardware three and a hundred watts of power. And really, if we really optimize it could be probably less than 50 watts. - What have you learned about developing Optimus?  About applying, integrating this kind of real world AI into the space of robotic manipulation, just humanoid robotics? What are some interesting tiny  or big things you've understood? - I was surprised at the fact that we had to develop every part of the robot ourselves. That there were no off the shelf motors, electronics,  sensors, like we had to develop everything. We couldn't actually find a source of electric motors for any amount of money.  - [Lex] So it's not even just the efficient, inexpensive, it's like anything, there's not a... - No, - [Lex] The actuators, everything, everything has to be? - Yeah. - [Lex] Designed from scratch. - We tried hard to find anything that was, because you think of how many electric motors are made  in the world. There's like tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of electric motor designs. None of them were suitable for a humanoid robot. Literally none.  So we had to develop our own design specifically for what a humanoid robot needs. - How hard was it to design something that can be mass manufactured, could be relatively inexpensive?  I mean, if you compare to Boston Dynamics Atlas, that's a very expensive robot. - It is designed to be manufactured in the same way that we would make a car. And I think ultimately we can make Optimists for less than the cost of a car. It should be.  'Cause if you look at the mass of the robot is much smaller and the car has many actuators in it. The car has more actuators than the robot. - But there is, the actuators are kind of interesting  in a humanized robot with the fingers. So Optimus has really nice, hands and fingers, you know? - [Elon] Yeah. - And they could do some interesting manipulation. Soft touch robotics.  - I mean, one of the tests goals I have is, can it pick up a needle and a thread and thread the needle, just by looking. - How far away are we from that? Just by looking, just by looking. - Maybe a year.  Although I go back to, I'm optimistic on time. The work that we're doing in the car will translate to the robot. - The perception or the, also the control? - No, the controls are different, but the video in controls out,  the car is robot on four wheels. The Optimist is a robot with the hands and legs. - [Lex] So you can just... - But they're very similar. - So the entire machinery of the learning process end to end is just,  you just have a different set of controls? - Optimist will figure out how to do things by watching videos. - As the saying goes, \"Be kind for everyone you meet is fighting a battle, you know nothing about.\" - [Elon] Yeah, it's true. - What's something difficult  you're going through that people don't often see? - Trying to defeat Uber Lilith? (laughing) No, I mean, you know,  I mean, my mind is a storm and I don't think, I don't think most people would wanna be me. They may think they would wanna be me, but they don't know. They don't understand.  - How are you doing? - I mean, overall, okay. In the grand scheme of things, I can't complain. - Do you get lonely? - Sometimes.  But I, you know, my kids and friends keep me company. - So not existential. - There are many nights I sleep alone.  I don't have to, but I do. - Walter Isaacson, in his new biography of you wrote about your difficult childhood. Will you ever find forgiveness in your heart for everything that has happened to you  in that period of your life? - What is forgiveness? I do not... At least I don't think I have a resentment,  so nothing to forgive. - You know, forgiveness is difficult for people. It seems like you don't harbor the resentment. - I mean, I try to think about like,  what is gonna affect the future in a good way. And holding onto grudges does not affect the future in a good way. - You're a father, a proud father.  What have you learned about life from your kids? Those little biological organisms? - I mean, developing AI and watching, say little X grow  is fascinating because they, they're far more parallels than I would've expected. I mean, I can see his biological neural net making more and more sense to the world.  And I can see the digital neural net making more and more sense of the world at the same time. - Do you see the beauty in magic in both? - Yes. I mean, one of the things with kids is that, you know,  you kind of see the world anew in their eyes. You know, to them everything is new and fresh. And then when you see that,  them experience the world is new and fresh, you do too. - Well. Elon, I just wanna say thank you for your kindness to me and friendship over the years.  For seeing something in a silly kid like me, as you've done for many others. And thank you for having hope for a positive future, for humanity, and for working your ass off to make it happen. Thank you, Elon. - [Elon] Thanks Lex. - Thank you for listening to this conversation  with Elon Musk. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words that Walter Isaacson wrote about the central philosophy of how Elon approaches difficult problems.  \"The only rules are the ones dictated by the laws of physics.\" Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely, absolutely. And it went beyond that. And there were BBC specials that helped propagate this. And one of the goals of the podcast  has been to try and shed, shine light on ideas that at first seem crazy. I know you and I are both semi-obsessed with the health benefits of light. And you hear about this stuff like negative ion therapy. It sounds crazy, right?  Sounds like something you would only hear about at Esalen or in Big Sur. Turns out negative ionization therapy for sleep and mood is based on really amazing work out of Columbia by a guy named Michael Terman. The Nobel Prize, I think it was in 1916,  was given for phototherapy for the treatment of lupus. This idea that certain wavelengths of light can help treat medical conditions is not a new idea. But somehow, we see a red light. We're not used to seeing red lights except in sunsets and on stoplights.  And somehow, it bothers people or it makes them feel like-- RICK RUBIN: It undermines a business model that doesn't take red light into consideration. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Until it does and then  it was-- and then it's co-opted there. And the place what I look to is acupuncture. For a lot of years, people said, well, acupuncture, this is like no mechanism, no mechanism, no mechanism. There's a lab at Harvard, a guy named Qiufu Ma, who I reasonably well, whose laboratory  is dedicated to trying to figure out the biological mechanisms of acupuncture. And they are discovering what everyone is known for thousands of years, which is that incredible effects on anti-inflammation, the gut microbiome. RICK RUBIN: I have a friend who was  having a terrible back problem. And I suggested that he see an acupuncturist. And he went to the acupuncturist that I suggested. And his back problem completely healed almost instantaneously.  And I asked him, have you been keeping up, because he had another flare up. He's like, no. I can't go back there because acupuncture doesn't work. I said, well, you saw it work for you. He's like, yeah, but there's no science.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow, he's got it-- now there's good science and published in premier journals. What's interesting is there's a little bit of science editorial, but since we like to exchange information about health and things of that sort, the editorial staff  of a journal dictates what gets published and what doesn't. And the premier journals have an outsized effect on what the media covers. And so the beautiful thing is the journal staff now  is of the age that they grew up hearing about acupuncture, hypnosis has a powerful clinical effect if it's done right, yoga nidra and similar practices. And so the tides are changing, but I sometimes  like to take a step back and think, what are we confronted with now that seems crazy that in 10 years, the kids that will be the-- because to me they're kids, will be journal editors. I'm like, oh yeah, absolutely. I'm making this up but putting tuning forks  against your head or something like that, like sound wave therapy. I think when one adopts a stance of-- we have to filter everything through the limitations  of our biology, but also through the sociology, the way culture goes, it becomes a different story. How do you deal with that, not just in terms of health, but in terms of thinking about anything?  It sounds like you don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about what people are going to think is cool or not. RICK RUBIN: No, I can't. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're a punk rocker at heart. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You still are there, I got you. RICK RUBIN: I can't. I just know what I like and what I don't. I know what works for me and what doesn't. I try things.  And I'm constantly looking for new better solutions to anything. And wherever they come from doesn't matter. It could come from-- it could come from Stanford or it could come from the guy talking to himself on the street.  If it works, I'm good. It doesn't really matter to me at all. I don't hold any of it tightly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, fortunately, there's now a division of the National Institutes  of Health called complementary and alternative health. And it's amazing. NCCIH is run by a woman who has published on--  this is interesting, some of the anti-cancer effects of things like acupuncture, not that acupuncture  can cure all cancers, but real data that I think for a lot of people, certainly of the generation above us, they just are not interested.  It sheds new light on the Andrew Wiles, the Paul Stametses, the wild ones. RICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy, there are so many. There's so many we can look at. I mean for a long time, nutrition  was just thought of as something that doesn't matter what you eat. It's what medicine you take and what-- the food is everything. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Food is a powerful variable.  In the landscape of online nutrition, it's one of the third rails for anyone like myself who's out there on social media. You do a very good job of putting out posts on Twitter and Instagram, but each day you take it down, you put up a new one. RICK RUBIN: And I don't talk about any--  I only talk about-- I talk about creative ideas. I don't talk about anything specific related to anything other than maybe something like, don't believe what you hear. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's right, exactly.  Well, in the landscape of nutrition sometimes I now place it through the filter of professional wrestling. You've got your vegans, and your omnivores, and your carnivore MD. And you've got liver king.  And you've got everything in between. So you could translate that to any number of different areas. Fashion probably has its people. I'm just not aware of who they are. Music has theirs. And sports has theirs.  And science has theirs characters. So are we all just pro-wrestling characters in these different domains and we're taking ourselves and each other way too seriously? RICK RUBIN: Yeah, it's all-- we don't know anything.  If someone has an idea and it sounds interesting, do you try it. And if it doesn't work, it's OK and try something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're an empiricist. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, whatever works, whatever works. And if something seems interesting to you  and you're excited by it, why not try it? I try very fringy things. I like, in some ways, the more unrealistic it seems, the more interesting it is to me  because I feel like that's getting closer to something that somebody doesn't want me to know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But you're not a big drug guy like the big psychedelic craze that's happening now and that happened some years.  RICK RUBIN: I'm not against it. It's just has never been something that I've done. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, yeah, it's an interesting area that's definitely making headway inside of standard academic science and medicine now.  RICK RUBIN: I'm interested in non-pharmacological approaches to things, whatever they are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm a big believer that also that behavioral do's and don'ts, first, are that they're the most fun to explore because, in general,  unless it's something like jumping between buildings, doing parkour, or something, most of the time, you're not going to injure or harm yourself. There's more room for iteration than there is with a pill or a potion.  Although, certainly, pharmacology has its place. So you've had creative works certainly within the realm of music, also comedy, and producing film, and other things.  For somebody out there who, of whatever age, maybe they're creating, maybe they know they have this creative antennae, the sources outside. What was it that Strummer said?  I actually wrote this on the wall of my laboratory. No input no output. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That Strummer's law. It's written in my laboratory. The people in my lab were like, what's going on here? I think one guy knew what that was, but it was a picture of him, and picture of my bull dog, and no input no output.  I don't think I can just stay in a room with four walls, and a ceiling, and nothing else and create. I mean, I know that there are certain number of things in here, but I do think accessing the world is important. RICK RUBIN: And the world is giving us clues all the time. If we're paying attention, that's another part of it.  If you're paying attention, the thing that you are looking for is being either whispered or screamed at you in the outside world if you're paying attention.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I forget the exact title of the chapter, but there's a chapter about staying open to clues or being on the lookout for clues.  Now, I feel tempted to look for the exact title of that chapter. RICK RUBIN: It's probably look for clues is what I guess. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Look for clues sounds like it sounds right. And since you wrote it, I'm guessing that's right. RICK RUBIN: Well it's something like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So do you think there are clues in everywhere?  RICK RUBIN: Yes, I think there are clues everywhere. If we pay attention, we'll hear a phrase. It'll trigger a thought. We'll see something unexpected.  If someone recommends something to you, maybe it's a coincidence. If three people recommend the same thing to you maybe it's not, who knows? Who knows?  I do believe the universe is on the side of creativity. And the universe is supporting things to happen. And they can happen through you or they could  happen through someone else. So if you're paying attention, maybe it'll happen through you. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We had a guest on the podcast named Justin Sonnenburg. He's an expert in the gut microbiome. And he applied something that-- without knowing,  he applied the opposite principle, the opposite is true principle. We were talking about these trillions of gut microbiota that clearly are doing amazing things to create, neurotransmitters, and govern our brain, and even decision making, how much sugar is in our system  driving appetite, et cetera. And he said, we think of them as cargo, but maybe we're just vehicles and they're in charge. That all of our interactions like every time we shake hands or touch our eyes, we're exchanging gut microbiota.  And we think of intelligence as thinking and intelligence. And he's a microbiologist. And in all seriousness he said, maybe we're the ones being manipulated. We're the house cats. And we think here we are, we're falling in love,  and kissing, and shaking hands, and washing hands, and doing all sorts of things to isolate or connect with one another. And maybe the gut microbiota are really trying to optimize their survival. RICK RUBIN: That's what Laird Hamilton said that at one point in the sauna--  that when you're in the sauna, it's really hot. The feeling that you have of wanting to get out could be the bad critters in your body that can't handle it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like let's get out of here.  RICK RUBIN: Are trying to convince you, from the inside, to get out. Maybe that's where the feeling of being compelled to get out comes from. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So Elon getting us all to Mars might be a bit of-- maybe they just want to get to Mars.  And so they're RICK RUBIN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because I'm starting to feel like I'm channeling Lex Freedman here for a moment. No, I think this considering the opposite is really key. And while it might sound mystical to people or a little bit like we're just playing with ideas, that's exactly what you do in science.  Someone walks in with a result and says, I found this. This is true. And you say, but what if it's all something else? A good example might be-- here I'm pulling from podcast episodes that we've had. But Alia Crum is this amazing psychologist who works on belief effects.  Your knowledge strongly shapes the physiological outcome. And she had this amazing graduate thesis where she said, what if all of exercise is placebo, all of it? Yeah, burn some calories and does some things. Turns out this isn't the case.  But it turns out a lot of the effects of exercise, positive effects-- lowering blood pressure, relieving stress, positive are placebo but nobody thinks of it like that because we're so attached to calories burned, et cetera. RICK RUBIN: I think that's a big point  that the belief part of it is a huge part of the conversation about everything. What we believe has power. If we believe we can make something great, the chances of us making something great  are better than if we don't believe we can. So I would say, any ability to harness your belief on your behalf is a really healthy thing to do.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: And one thing that you make very clear is that while our own abilities may come into question from time to time, you absolutely believe that the elements from which to create are out there.  RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. All the elements are here. Everything is here. We get to pick and choose. We get to-- the conveyor belts going by with the little gifts.  And we can-- first, we have to notice there's a conveyor belt. Then we notice the gifts. And then that's the starting point. And then we may even feel empowered enough  to grab one of the gifts, and open it up, and see what's inside. And then maybe that started something really beautiful that we wouldn't have done. Everything that I make or have made  has always been based on something that I see or hear that allows me to see something that I didn't see before. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I was going to ask you whether or not,  it's important to be happy in order to create, but certainly a lot of people that were unhappy were still able to create. But the more I listen to you, it seems that it's really about an ability to pay attention. RICK RUBIN: Yes.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: So if I'm unhappy or if I'm happy may not be as relevant as whether or not I'm able to stay undistracted. RICK RUBIN: Yes. I would say that's-- I would say being able to stay present in the work is probably  the most important part of it. And how you feel is less of an issue unless how you feel gets in the way of you feeling how the work makes you feel. Do you know what I'm saying?  If you're in a lot of pain and you're looking at a piece of art, it may be hard to know how that art makes you feel because you're-- the big signal in your body is the physical pain.  I'm sure there are some people who can do that too, who can, even through the physical pain, can feel it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, there's this idea of transmutation, of taking one emotion and contorting it and co-opting it into another action in an adaptive way.  But this idea of distraction being a problem, this really resonates, I think. When I think of times of great productivity is when I was able to be undistracted. I could also see how success can be its own distraction. This is often discussed in the context of fighting sports,  where someone starts making a lot of money and pretty soon their focus becomes all the things they can access with their success as opposed to the thing that got them there in the first place. Keeping an underdog mentality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Before we conclude,  I do want to ask you about one other aspect of process, which is meditation. Meditation is interesting to me because when we close our eyes as most meditations are done and we focus on our brain, our brain has no sensation.  Like if we-- RICK RUBIN: I wouldn't say we focus on our brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or we focus on something other than our normal experience, is that-- how would you define meditation? RICK RUBIN: Well, there's different-- there are different types of meditation.  Either way, I would say there is no form of meditation where we're focused on our brain. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good. I'm glad we disagree. RICK RUBIN: I would say, here are the things that happen. We either are engaging in a mantra, which  would be a version of almost creating a trance for ourselves, not unlike listening to something when we go to sleep that would distract our conscious mind from participating.  We would be overriding the talking mind with just a sound that we're generating, or a word, or phrase, a series of phrases.  Meta meditation is a loving kindness meditation with phrases, could be that or it could be focused on the breath. But the purpose of being focused on the breath  is to not hear the self-talk that we normally have. It's a single pointed focus exercise in those that I described.  The other version is an awareness meditation, where you're closing your eyes. And you're being with whatever is and noticing-- so if we were to do it now, and you could do it  eyes open or eyes closed with an awareness practice. But the first thing that I would do is I would feel-- I feel a little ringing in my ears. It might be from the electronic equipment around us. And I don't mean that I hear the sound.  It's like a vibration. I hear cars passing in the distance. Let's see what else comes out, I can feel a feeling in my chest.  I can feel this part of my face. I'm not sure why. It feels like it's related to my jaw. More car sounds.  I'm aware of a little feeling of warmth. So now, I would say the room feels a bit warm. I wasn't aware of that before, when I wasn't just being with what's happening. I feel a little itch on my left shoulder.  So that would be an awareness practice, which is another kind of meditation where you're just paying attention to what's going on. There's no story. There's no this means this. None of those things.  It's like an inventory, almost, of everything that comes up when it comes up. And you do that for a period of time. But in all of those cases, in the example of doing the awareness meditation,  or doing a mantra meditation, or focusing on the breath, in none of them am I thinking. And none of them am I concentrating on--  I'm being aware of sense perceptions in the awareness one or in the other meditations. I'm doing a practice so that I'm not  aware of thinking about anything else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When did you start meditating and how often do you meditate now? RICK RUBIN: I learned when I was 14. And I started with TM. And that's probably the meditation that I've done the most in my life and I come back to.  Although I tried many different kinds and also different physical forms of meditation-- Tai Chi, things like that. I meditated for five or six years. And then I stopped when I went to school, to university.  And then I started again several years later. And when I started again, I realized how profound it wasn't in me that I had done it when I did it  So I usually have some sort of a practice. In some ways, the beach walks could be a form of meditation.  But for me, typically, I would wake up. It'd be the first thing I would do during that in-between time, maybe go out in the sun, close my eyes, and meditate before starting my day.  If I'm doing it twice a day, the second time would probably be right before dinner if I'm doing it on a regular schedule. Then if I find myself on an airplane, I might meditate for an hour.  I can remember, one time, meditating the entire flight from New York to LA, just was a great opportunity to do a deep dive. And time passes. You lose track of time. You don't even know--  it's like going to sleep and waking up. You don't feel like that was eight hours. It's just time stops. Not always, but when it does, it's a great feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, you've sent me some meditations including the one that you  did on that transatlantic-- transcontinental flight. And I've been trying to get-- do longer and longer meditations, but I've always meditated a little bit. But your meditation practice is one that I'm starting to adopt, maybe we could convince you to give us  a suggestions of one or two and we can link out to them for listeners. I'm sure they'd appreciate. RICK RUBIN: And there's also meditation like practices to do that involve--  there's something called the surgical series from the Monroe Institute which I used when I had a surgery. You listen to this recording.  And it both allows your body to heal much faster and remove some of the trauma that goes on when getting cut  open-- it's traumatic. But just through listening to certain things, you can have a really powerful effect, heal much faster.  I remember I was about to be put under for a surgery. And my eyes were closed. And I wasn't communicating with anyone  there because I was going inside. And my wife was with me. And they came in. And they said, oh, so they already gave Rick the sedative because he's ready to go in. I don't think you gave him anything.  He's like, look at his numbers. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. Yeah, it's an amazingly powerful practice that I like because anyone can cultivate. RICK RUBIN: Absolutely, absolutely.  And there's no good or bad version. It really is just-- if you learn a technique and show up and do it, it works. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I love that you're so willing to share what you do in your process.  Listen, I just want to say thank you for a number of things. I want to thank you for the music you've created and that you are to create because we want to be still ongoing, certainly for your time today in sharing  your thought process and a bit of what goes into this incredible creative process. And I want to thank you for writing the book. I don't talk about or feature many books on the podcast. It's just not something we typically do,  but I've seen a little bit of the evolution of it. And then I've seen it now and read through it in its final form twice, as I mentioned. And I'm going to continue to read through it again. It is one of those books where it is so filled with gems, like every chapter.  I could take notes on this. And take notes on this. And it's assembled in a very digestible way that allows people to extract the meaningful parts in every chapter. And there are so many in a way that's very straightforward.  So I love the book. So thank you for doing it because you certainly didn't have to write a book. But I'm so happy that you did. And I know that I've already benefited I know so many people are going to benefit. It's an amazing book. And I couldn't help but put my neuroscience lens on it.  But I also, about halfway through, I learned to discard my pre-existing lens a bit and start to see things through what I think is a different perspective. So I just want to thank you for being such an incredible portal and also for being an amazing friend. RICK RUBIN: Thank you.  I love you. I'm so happy to be here with you. And any time I get to see you, it's a good day. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Likewise. Thank you for joining me today for my discussion with Rick Rubin-- all about creativity and the creative process. Please also be sure to check out his new book, The Creative Act--  A Way of Being by Rick Rubin. As I mentioned earlier, it's an incredible book and such a wealth of knowledge for you creative types out there, for those of you that seek to be more creative, or to understand the creative process generally. And as I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,  Rick has very generously offered to answer your questions about creativity. So if you have questions for Rick Rubin about creativity, or the creative process, or anything else for that matter, please put those in the comment section on YouTube by writing in capital letters, QUESTION FOR RICK RUBIN.  And then please put the question in there. That will make it easier for me to find those questions. I will record the conversation where I asked Rick, those questions. And of course, we will post his answers to those questions on our Huberman Lab clips channel. If you're learning from and/or enjoying this podcast,  please subscribe to our YouTube channel.

[MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology, at Stanford School of Medicine.  Today, my guest is Rick Rubin. Rick Rubin is credited with being one of the most creative and prolific music producers of all time. The range of artists with whom he's worked with and discovered is absolutely staggering, ranging from artists such as LL Cool J, Public Enemy, Minor Threat,  Fugazi, Beastie Boys, Jesus and Mary Chain, Jay-Z, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Green Day, Tom Petty, System of a Down, Joe Strummer, Kanye West, Johnny Cash, Adele, and many, many more. Not surprisingly, therefore, Rick  is considered somewhat of an enigma. That is, people want to know how it is that one individual is able to extract the best creative artistry from so many different people in so many different genres of music. Well, as today's discussion reveals,  Rick's expertise in the creative process extends well beyond music. In fact, our conversation takes us into the realm of what the creative process is specifically and generally across domains, including music, of course, but also writing, film, science,  and essentially, all domains in which new, original thought, ideas, and production of anything becomes important. Our conversation ventures from abstract themes, such as what is creativity, and where does it stem from, to the more concrete,  everyday, tool-based approaches to creativity, including those that Rick himself uses and that he's seen other people use to great success. That took us down some incredible avenues, ranging from a discussion about the subconscious, to how the subconscious interacts with our conscious mind, and how the subconscious  and conscious mind interact with nature around us and within us. Indeed, our conversation got rather scientific at times, but all with an eye and an ear toward understanding the practical tools that any and all of us can use in order to access the creative process.  We also spent some time talking about Rick's new book, which is all about creativity and ways to access creativity. The title of the book is The Creative Act: A Way of Being, by Rick Rubin. This is a book that I've now read three times from cover to cover, and I'm now  reading it a fourth time. Because it is so rich with wisdom and information that I'm applying in multiple domains of my life, not just my work but my everyday life. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Rick has an incredible ability to translate his understanding  of the creative process in a way that is meaningful for anybody. So if you're in music, if you're a musician, it will certainly be meaningful for you, but it is not about music. It is about the creative process. And so whether or not you consider yourself somebody creative or not, or whether or not you  seek to be more creative, Rick's book and today's conversation sheds light on what I believe to be the fundamental features of what makes us human beings. That is what allows us, unlike other animals, to look out on the landscape around us, to examine our inner landscape, and to come up  with truly novel ideas that thrill us, entertain us, entertain other people, scare us, make us laugh, make us cry. All the things that make life rich are essentially contained in the creative process.  And to be able to sit down and learn from the Rick Rubin how the creative process emerges in him and his observations about how we can best emerge in others is and was truly a gift. So I'm excited to share his knowledge with you today. One thing that you'll quickly come to notice about today's conversation  is that Rick is incredibly generous with his knowledge about the creative process. In fact, he very graciously, and spontaneously I should add, offered to answer your questions about creativity. So if you have questions about the creative process for Rick,  please, put those in the Comment section on YouTube. And in order to make those questions a bit easier for me to find, please, put \"Question for Rick Rubin\" in capitals, then colon or dash, whichever you choose, and then put your question there. I do ask that you keep the questions relatively short,  so that I can ask Rick as many of those questions as possible. We will record that conversation, and we will post it as a clip on the Huberman Lab Clips channel. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is, however, part of my desire and effort  to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is Maui Nui, which I can confidently say is the most nutrient-dense and delicious red meat available.  Maui Nui spent nearly a decade building a USDA-certified, wild harvesting system to help balance invasive deer populations on the island of Maui. I've talked before on this podcast, and we've had guests on this podcast, that have emphasized the critical role of getting quality  protein, not just for muscle repair and protein synthesis but also for repair of all tissues, including brain tissue, on a day-to-day basis. And the general rule of thumb for that is 1 gram of quality protein, per pound of body weight, per day.  With Maui Nui meats, you can accomplish that very easily, and you can do that without ingesting an excess of calories, which is also critical for immediate and long-term health. I should say, that Maui Nui he meets are not only extremely high quality, but they are also delicious.  I particularly like their jerky, so their venison jerky. I also have had Maui Nui venison in various recipes, including ground venison, some venison steaks, and I love the taste of the venison. It's lean, but it doesn't taste overly lean or dry at all.  It's incredibly delicious. So if you'd like to try Maui Nui venison, go to mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off your first order. Again, that's mauinuivenison.com/huberman to get 20% off your first order. Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.  Thesis makes custom nootropics, and as many of you have probably heard me say before, I am not a fan of the word nootropics, because nootropics means smart drugs, and frankly, the brain doesn't work that way. The brain has neural circuits for focus. It also has neural circuits for creativity and neural  circuits for task switching and for imagination and for memory. There is no such thing as a neural circuit for being smart, and therefore, the word nootropics doesn't really apply to anything specific, neurobiologically speaking. Thesis understands this, and therefore,  has designed custom nootropics that are tailored to your unique needs. I've been using Thesis for over a year now, and their nootropic formulas have been a game-changer for me, in particular in the realm of cognitive work. My go-to formula for when I'm doing any kind of cognitive work is their clarity formula.  That's the one I've been using most often, lately. If you'd like to try Thesis customized nootropics, you can go online to takethesis.com/huberman. You'll take a brief three-minute quiz, and Thesis will send you four different formulas to try in your first month.

WHOOP is a fitness wearable device that tracks your daily activity and sleep but goes beyond activity and sleep tracking  to provide real-time feedback on how to adjust your training and sleep schedules in order to feel and perform better. Six months ago, I started working with WHOOP as a member of their Scientific Advisory Council, as a way to help WHOOP advance their mission of unlocking human performance.  And as a WHOOP user, I've experienced firsthand the health benefits of their technology. It's clear, based on quality research, that WHOOP can inform you how well you're sleeping, how to change your sleep habits, how to change your activity habits, even how to modify different aspects  of your nutrition, exercise, sleep, and lifestyle in order to maximize your mental health, physical health, and performance. So whether or not you're an athlete, or you're exercising simply for health, WHOOP can really help you understand how your body functions under different conditions  and how to really program your schedule, nutrition, and exercise and many other factors of your life, in order to really optimize your health and performance, including your cognition. If you're interested in trying WHOOP, you can go to join WHOOP-- spelled W-H-O-O-P-- dotcom slash Huberman.  That's joinwhoop.com/huberman today, and get your first month free.

Great to have you here today, Rick. RICK RUBIN: Thank you for having me. It's a pleasure.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: So of all the topics in science, and in particular in neuroscience, I confess that creativity is the most difficult one to capture. Because you can find papers, scientific studies  that is, on convergent thinking versus divergent thinking, and there are definitions to these, and they take on different forms. But in a strict definition form, it seems that creativity has something  to do with either rearranging existing elements or coming up with new elements. But as I went into your book, which I've done twice. I've read it twice, and by the way, I feel so blessed and honored to have  gotten an early copy from you, or a final copy early that is. But having gone through it twice, I'm now convinced that there may not actually  be an internal source of creativity that exists on its own right. And the example that you give that, for me, really is serving as an anchor, and tell me if I'm wrong here, is this idea that ideas and creativity are a little bit like a cloud.  If you look at it at one moment, you might think that it looks like one thing, where it has a certain shape and texture. But then you look at it a moment later, it could be quite a bit different. And if you look at it an hour later, it very well could be gone.  And the reason I think that serves as such a powerful hook for me to think about creativity and why I think neuroscientists and scientists in general have never actually captured a way to even talk about creativity stems from somebody  that you knew in person but, as you know, I greatly admire. I don't have many heroes, but I would put Joe Strummer among the short list of heroes that I have. And I remember once an interview with him fairly disjointed.  He was off in different tangents that I couldn't follow. But at one point, he just blurted out that, if you have an idea, you have to write it down. And you may end up throwing it away, but if you wait,  it will be gone. And I remember that, and as a consequence, I have a whole system that I use to try and capture ideas. But what are your thoughts on what Joe said, this cloud idea that comes up in one form in one area of the book?  But then I think it's thread throughout the book in different ways. How did that come to you, and how does it serve you in trying to-- I don't want to say extract-- but trying to access creativity? RICK RUBIN: I think the best way to think  about it is like a dream. It's like, if you think about your dreams, they don't necessarily make sense. When you wake up, you might remember part but not the whole thing.  Then, if you start writing them down, they'll come back, and they may not make sense to you. There'll be a series of abstract images, and maybe, someday in the future,  you'll be able to look back and understand what they mean, and maybe not. And that's how the art making process works is like we're making things, and we're looking for feeling in ourselves.  And it could be a feeling of excitement or enthusiasm, a feeling of interest, a feeling of curiosity-- I want to know more-- a feeling of leaning forward.  And we're following that energy in our body, when we feel there's something here. There's something here. I want to know more. I want to know more. I want to know more.  I'll say, it's not an intellectual process. It's a different thing. That's why it's hard even to talk about it, because it's so elusive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Recently, I was listening  to a podcast by our friend Lex Fridman. I think it was an episode with Balaji Srinivasan, where Balaji, who's an investor-type guy, thinker-type guy-- this is like an eight-hour episode.  He says something at the beginning that I'd love your thoughts on. He said, look, we can train a rat to lever press every other time or to expect reward on every even number press  or every odd number press or even every fifth number press. But a human and a rat can't do that for like prime number presses. You can't actually train that. And then you think about the reward systems and the way  that we follow life, from when we get up until we go to sleep, and what he said is the fact that we can't do that means that we may not actually be in touch with the best schedules of doing things.  Like every time I'm thirsty, I take a sip. I assume that's the right way to do it, but it might not be optimal, for whatever purpose. When I was reading your book, I was thinking about there's  a set of things to follow, things to pay attention to-- you talk about this-- things to access, that none of the creative process comes from just within us. It can, but it's always being fed by things outside of it. And so what I started to do is, the second time  I read through the book, was think about it through the lens of what Balaji was saying was that there may not even be a language for this thing that we call accessing creativity. There's a process, but that language in the form of words  is a little bit like trying to use even numbers to try and access prime numbers. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like the math becomes so convoluted that we end up in a conversation like this,  where I'm confident we can get to the kernels of it. Because what's remarkable about the book is that you do. You show and inform the process.  But there may not be a English or any other language for saying, do this, then this, then this, then this, and you'll have something of creative value. Does that capture it? RICK RUBIN: Yes.  I think language is insufficient to drill down on creativity. It's closer to magic than it is science.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: So when kids come into the world, do you think that they have better access to this creative process than we do as adults? Because we start to impart rule plays and books. Like will it get likes? Will people like it?  But also all the things that are available to us that we're not paying attention to, like the texture of this table, we're discarding things, systematically. We get, quote, unquote, set in our ways.  Do you think kids are, just by definition and by design, more creative than adults? RICK RUBIN: Yes. Kids, they're open, and they have no baggage. They don't have any belief system. They don't know how things are supposed to work.  They just see what is, and if we pay attention to what is, we learn much more than if we-- Most of us select from an endless number of data points  available to us to, well, as a species, to make sure that we don't die and to procreate and to feed ourselves are probably the primary functions first.  And then we learn things about what's right and what's wrong, and we learn things about how to do certain things. Or we're inspired by someone who makes something we love, and we want to do it the way they do it.  And all of those things undermine the purity of the creative process. They can be tools to build your skill set to be able to do it yourself. Like if you're a singer, you might  imitate a singer you really like for a while to get good at it and then eventually come to find your own voice. It doesn't always start with your own voice. But if you're three years old or five years old,  and you try singing, you're not singing like anyone else. You're singing with your own voice. And when you make something, you're making it based on not knowing. And I think I had the advantage, early in my career,  of starting making music without any experience, which was helpful, because I didn't know what rules I was breaking. And so it wasn't intentional breaking of rules. I just did what seemed right to me,  but I didn't realize that I was doing things that other people wouldn't do. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There is this idea that there are no new ideas. I disagree, because every once in a while, I'll see or hear something that at least seems  different enough. RICK RUBIN: I think it's a combination of-- a new combination of existing ideas presented in a new way. I think that's how it works. I don't know.  But I will say, it does seem like the things that are most interesting to me have a series of familiar elements joined together in a way that it's creating something that I've never seen before.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned that when you are close to or you see hints of creativity that is of real value that it's a feeling, and I also believe that the body is a great source of information.  Which once people will realize that the brain, of course, is in the skull, but the nervous system extends everywhere in the body, the whole mind-body thing just falls away. Philosophers have argued about this forever, but it's a silly argument.  It's also true that, God forbid, I were to amputate all my limbs, have them amputated, I'd fundamentally still be me. Right? The same is not true if we took out a big enough chunk of my brain, and I still survived. I would be a fundamentally different human being.  I'd still have the same name and identity and social security number, but I would behave very differently. Who knows, maybe better?  The signals from the body we know, or at least we assume, are pretty generic. Like I can think of 50 different ways or 100 ways that we could talk about creativity today. And we could define it and redefine it and carve it up  and serve it up like sushi in a bunch of different ways. But the body sends signals that most of us are-- we have a course understanding of. It's like, oh, my stomach hurts, or my stomach feels good, or I'm not sensing my stomach.  Or oh, that feels good. It feels warm. It feels cold. Like most of us aren't trained in understanding how to interpret those signals. So it's almost like you have a few vowels, a few syllables, and there isn't a lot more. Whereas, we talk about our thoughts and our experiences,  depending on how hyper verbal somebody is and how much emphasis they put on different sounds, it's near infinite. Not infinite, but near infinite. So for you personally, when you know  that you're on the end of a thread of creativity-- maybe you're listening to an artist, or you're hearing something. And you're like there and the your antennae start to deflect in a certain way. Right?  Do you feel that in your body as a recognizable sensation, or is it a thought and a sensation? RICK RUBIN: It's a feeling in my body. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it localized? RICK RUBIN: No.  It's a feeling of-- I would say it's like a surge of energy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you remember the first time you experienced that? RICK RUBIN: Probably hearing the Beatles, when I was three or four years old.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: Three or four years old? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there something wrong with me that the Beatles have never done it for me? RICK RUBIN: No. Maybe you just weren't exposed at the right time in the right way. There's no right or wrong way, and everyone--  I can love the Beatles, and you can not, and we're both right. There's not-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm glad we can still be friends. I was a little concerned. I was a little scared to ask you that question. I know my taste in music is a little bit obscure and fragmentary, but good. I've always felt like, gosh, there  must be something wrong with me. I like their songs, but they don't-- there's no juice for me there. RICK RUBIN: I think maybe we'll watch-- there was an eight-part series called The Beatles Anthology, which is out of print. But I can try to find it somewhere,  and we can watch that together, and maybe that'll make the case for the Beatles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Nothing against them, it's just I'm always bothering you for a story, but like Ramones. I saw that, and I was like, wow, like jeans, aviators, everyone had to change their last name  to Ramone, a lot of them hated each other. There's so much drama in there, and three chords and just-- but to me, it just was like, wow, like kids from New York, that energy. So I think different things for different people. Right? RICK RUBIN: Absolutely. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that brings me  to a question of when something feels creatively right, and you're sensing it, and you're there, let's say in the studio or maybe even you're listening to something that somebody sent you,  how do you translate that, given the absence of language? How do you translate that into a conversation with the artist? And again, this could be about writing or comedy or science or podcasting, for that matter.  How do you say that, keep going that way, when they might not even recognize that they did it? And I'm guessing a lot of times, they don't. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. Sometimes, they don't. It depends. When we're in the--  I'll try to be in a setting where, as we're talking about it, we can engage with it in that moment. So it's not much good. Let's say I was producing your new record,  and you played me something, and I had some thoughts about it. It wouldn't be so helpful for me to tell you what those were. It'd be better for us to wait till we were in a place where we could try things and see where it goes.  So the first thing is I wouldn't rely on language to do it. It would be more of making a suggestion of something that's actionable. We try it, and then we have more data.  And either we're moving in a good direction, or we're moving away from-- we're moving towards it or away from it, and we never know. And so it's always an experiment. And maybe a simple way to talk about it would be like, if I gave you two dishes of food and asked  you to taste them and tell me which one you like better. Usually, it's pretty straightforward, when you have two choices, which you like better, and I think most creativity can be boiled down to that. That's very different than I wonder  how this is going to perform on certain social media platforms? That's different than what is it-- when I'm tasting these two things, which is the one I want to finish eating? And if I were to say, I like this one better,  but it needs a little salt, and then put a little salt on it. It's like, maybe I put too much salt, and you know when you taste it. It's like it's that simple.  Being in tune enough with ourselves to really know how we feel in the face of knowing that other people might feel very differently, which is part of the challenge.  It's like, if everyone tells you A, A, A, A, A, A, and you listen, and you're like that's B, as an artist,  it's important to be able to say, to me, it's B. And it's a disconnect, because so much of, when we go to school, it's to get us to follow the rules.  And in art, it's different, because the rules are there as a scaffolding to be chipped away, as need be. Sometimes, they're helpful. Sometimes, they're not, and sometimes, we'll  even impose our own rules to give something its shape. So we can decide to make a-- we're going to make a painting, but we're only going to use green and red are the only colors we're allowed to use.  We decide that in advance, and then how do we solve the problem knowing all we have is green and red? It can-- because otherwise, if there's an infinite number of choices, anything can be anything.  It's like, sometimes more choices is not better. So limiting your palate to something manageable forces you to solve problems in a different way.  Now, in our digital age music-wise, you can make anything digitally. There's no-- there was a time when, if you didn't have a guitar in the studio, you couldn't record guitar.  Or if you couldn't hire an orchestra, there couldn't be orchestra on your recording. Now, you can just call any of those things up. So there's infinite choices, and infinite choices  don't necessarily lead to better compositions or better final works.  Understanding how you feel in the face of other voices, without second guessing yourself,  is probably the single most important thing to practice as an artist. Or a skill set to develop as an artist is to I know how you feel, and own your feelings.  And the key to that is not I know, so I know what's right for you. It doesn't work that way. It's just I know for me, and the reason I chose to be an artist is to demonstrate this is how I see it.  If I'm undermining my taste for some commercial idea, it defeats the whole purpose of doing this. That's not what this process is about.  This process is I'm doing me, and I'm showing you who I am. And you can like it or not, but either way, this is still how I see it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love that, because in science, having trained graduate students, having been  a graduate student, I was very blessed to have mentors, one of who is a real iconoclast. He's dead now. Actually, all my advisors are dead-- suicide, cancer, cancer. The joke is you don't want me to work for you. So they all had a morbid sense of humor,  so they're laughing about this, someplace, right now. RICK RUBIN: I thought you were going to say they all ate the poison mushrooms. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but the last one said to me, you're the common denominator, Andrew. And I thought, oh my goodness, and he  said, kind of just kidding, but not really. So it's a little bit eerie. But in any case, he always said-- his name was Ben-- he always said, the one thing I can't teach is taste,  and the one predictor I have of the people who will never develop it are the ones who are perfectionists. Because they're filtering their-- perfectionists that filter their perfection through the feedback of others. He was always looking for the person  that was putting up a little bit of a middle finger to feedback. Not so much that they would get things wrong, because it can be badly wrong in science. You can be wrong for the right reasons, but you can also be wrong for the wrong reasons.  But people that just had almost a compulsion to do it their way or to believe in what they were doing. And I'm hearing some of that, or I'm hearing that in what you're describing. I also think that there's something  about the human empathic process or the emotional process, where when we see somebody doing something and they seem to really not be paying attention to what anyone else is doing-- I guess the crazy person on the street is one version of it, where we go they're just in their experience,  and it's just crazy. But when somebody seems to be enjoying themselves or the emotion seems to be real, I think there are a good fraction of people who feel a gravitational pull, and they go, yeah, that.  And the best example I have of this is I remember growing up in the skateboard thing we were the first-- we were the first to start doing the baggy, sagging clothes thing, and we got teased endlessly one year in school. Then, there was a bunch of hip hop that came out,  and guys were wearing sagging their jeans or their shorts. Next year, we come back, and the very same people who were making fun of us we're all doing it, and that's when it clicked for me. I was like, most people don't actually know what they like. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They like what they ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "What determines what's real in creative storytelling?", "Question 2": "How should artists differ from commercial storytellers?", "Question 3": "What role does narrow visual focus play in creativity?", "Question 4": "Why is broadening vision essential for new ideas?", "Question 5": "How can humor relate to creative recognition?", "Question 6": "What challenges does science face regarding established knowledge?", "Question 7": "How does immediate feedback impact creativity today?", "Question 8": "What is the significance of the source in creativity?", "Question 9": "Why does novelty affect our appreciation of art?", "Question 10": "How do early music experiences shape our emotions?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "the question then is in this landscape of creative stuff whats real whats not real you know that these are its almost like whoever can create the most convincing story at least captures a good number of good fraction of audiences but thats not what the creative artists needs to do they need to actually depart from that", "Answer 2": "Artists need to depart from the practice of creating stories solely to please others, which is more of a commercial endeavor.

And so the question then is, in this landscape of creative stuff, what's real? What's not real?  It's almost like whoever can create the most convincing story at least captures a good number of-- a good fraction of audiences, but that's not what the creative artist needs to do. They need to actually depart from that. Do I have that right? RICK RUBIN: Well they're just two different things.  Like coming up with a story with the purpose of pleasing someone else is a skill set, but it's more of a commercial endeavor than an artistic endeavor. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's like tactical. Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. RICK RUBIN: Yeah.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was thinking, in your book, you describe, again, when you're thinking about the creative process as a cloud, for me, again, it serves as such a powerful anchor. And then I think about the biology, the neurobiology,  of like strategy formation or strategy implementation and then almost by sheer luck, or miraculously, I turn a few pages later into the book, and there's a description of how animals that are trying  to accomplish something-- eat, mate, find water, accomplish the requirements of living-- it requires a narrow visual focus. This is something my lab is obsessed with, and I've been obsessed with.  And in that more narrow visual focus, we know that the playbook becomes more narrow. The rule set is more narrow. Now, at some point, in order to come up with a new creative idea, that means  that broadening vision is essential, in some way, or broadening thinking. RICK RUBIN: Well, it could either be a broadening or a narrowing, but it's changing the aperture from the standard.  The reason we do this is to present something new that maybe you already knew but didn't know you knew it.  And for that to be the case, you have to be looking at it. It's not unlike what a comedian does. Comedian makes you laugh. Usually, what they're saying, it's outrageous, but you know that it's right. Just no one says it that way, or no one has said it that way before.  But it's always the truth in it that makes it funny. It's like that. It's the same idea as recognizing something  that seems really obvious, once you see it, but it seems like nobody else sees it, or no one else points it out. And I feel like science is like that too,  because how much of science, once the light flashes over your head, it's like I got it, it just seems like, well, we knew that forever. No one knew it, but do you know what I'm saying?  It's like it's so obvious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely. RICK RUBIN: It's so obvious. And I think another superpower of artists is this accepting we don't know anything. When we think we know things, that also limits our world.  We think we know it's only like this. This is all that's possible, where nice in this little box. But in reality, who's to say that's the case? Who's to say any of the-- we could  take all of what we believe in science now and decide to throw all of that away and start from scratch. And we'd probably create a whole different one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.  Athletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens. I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012. So that's 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens every single day. So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.  The reason I started taking Athletic Greens, and the reason I still take Athletic Greens, is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs. So whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not, I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs for vitamins, minerals, probiotics,  adaptogens to combat stress, and the digestive enzymes really help my digestion. I just feel much better when I'm drinking Athletic Greens. If you'd like to try Athletic Greens, you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman, and for the month of January, they have a special offer,  where they'll give you 10 free travel packs, plus a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2. Vitamin D3 and K2 are vital for immune function, metabolic function, hormone health, but also calcium regulation and heart health. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman  to claim their special offer, in the month of January, of 10 free travel packs, plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2. In an offline conversation one time, you asked a good friend of mine, who's been a guest on this podcast, Eddie Chang, who's  chair of neurosurgery, and I would place him in the top 1% of neuroscientists. He's pulling speech out of people who are completely paralyzed with locked-in syndrome, et cetera. And you asked him, what percentage of what's  contained in medical textbooks and training-- RICK RUBIN: Today ANDREW HUBERMAN: Today. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. If you went to medical school today, and you learned what was in the textbook, what percentage of that information is accurate, and what percentage is not? And he said, maybe half. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right, and you asked,  and what is the consequence of that? And he said, incalculable, and I completely agree. And I asked him a second time, and he still came up with the same answer. So that's a good sign. Reliability from experiment to the next is good. Yeah.  I think that there is this idea that we really know things. In science, we've observed amazing discoveries from chance. We've observed amazing discoveries  from incredible bouts of hard work. In both cases, people were spending a lot of time in the lab. Like no one walked into the lab, saw something one day, and had a Nobel Prize winning discovery or fundamental discovery. They were all hanging out in lab a lot.  Just some of them came up with something that they didn't expect. Others were drilling toward an answer. RICK RUBIN: And in all those cases, when the breakthroughs happen-- I'm guessing. I don't know this--  that considering we assume this information, then this discovery is true, based on everything that came before it.  But if everything that came before it is wrong, then the discoveries are probably built on a-- do you know what I'm saying? It's like the context, everything that happens takes into account that the context that it's sitting in it  fits in that context. Maybe that context isn't right. Who knows? We don't know. So I'm saying, we're too close to most things in thinking, when we think we things, where there are a lot  of assumptions that go into it. And that any new discoveries are essentially built on top of these beliefs, but they're beliefs. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I remember--  of course, I listened to the Beastie Boys growing up. Who didn't? I was a child of the 90s, and they were in the-- Sabotage was an outgrowth of a skateboarding movie, like Spike Jones and like the girl movies.  And those worlds, the Beastie Boys and skateboarding were really closely interwoven for a while. Some people know that. Some people don't. And Spike formed the bridge, and then Spike went off and started making more bigger movies that more people watch.  But let's just use them as an example. I heard you say once before that you guys were joking around, like Beastie Boys, like these guys doing hip hop, but it was kind of like the hardcore scene, in New York, punk rock scene, and it was a joke. There were a lot of inside jokes.  When you were working together, was there the thought that people might love it, might hate it, or you just weren't paying attention at all? RICK RUBIN: Weren't paying attention at all. Never considered it. There were no-- at that point in time,  when we were making Licensed to Ill, hip hop music was a tiny underground thing. And no one making hip hop at that time thought it would ever mean anything.  It was not a realistic thought. So we were making it really for our crazy friends, and that's it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So do you think, nowadays, the fact that one can create something and, quote, unquote, release it quickly.  I can put something out onto Twitter or Instagram now. We could do it in 10 seconds from now, and I will get immediate feedback, which is external feedback, of course, but then I can iterate on the basis of that feedback.  Do you think that's problematic for the larger opportunity for creativity? In other words, if we were to go back 20 years or even 15 years, when the opportunity to create was certainly still there,  but you really didn't know how it was going to land until you, quote, unquote, released it. It seems to me there was more opportunity to stay in that magical rainforest that is the creativity itself. RICK RUBIN: I don't think it's wrong or right.  It's just more information that you can use or not use and use it in a useful way. And you can make something and put it out, and people could not like it. And you're like, oh, they still don't get it. I'm going to I got to go harder.  Like I got to go harder in that direction not-- do you know what I'm saying? It's like not to react away from information. It can be helpful. It can be helpful when--  there could be different stories that happen at the same time. Where you're making something, and you have an idea of what it is. And then other people engage with it, and they have a different idea of what it is. And they like it for a different reason  than you did or dislike it for a reason different than the reason you like it. We can't control any of those things. The only part of it that we can control is how we relate to the thing that we make.  And any external information that undermines the clarity of that connection is probably bad for the art is my guess.  And again, I'm only saying this from my experience. I try to make things-- all I've ever tried to make was something I like or something that I felt like was missing as a fan that I wanted, and nobody was making it.  So I'll make it, but it wasn't-- it was always in the service of I love this thing. I want something like this. No one else is making one. I have to make one. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.  It's beautiful, because the word that keeps coming to mind is it's almost like a compulsion. Like there are other options of ways to be and to behave and to function and work in life. But if something is a compulsion,  it yanks us away from those other opportunities, just enough that we have to get back to it. You've talked before about, and you talk in the book, this notion of the source.  And to me, again, I can't help but put my neuroscientist lens on this. I think of the source as not one brain area but some function within the brain, where we are in touch  with our bodily signals. Like what feels right, what doesn't? Or like tasting the two foods, I love that example. And that it's a playbook that is far more  vast than the short term adaptive playbook, like this how I'm going to get from point A to point B. And yet, when I listen to an album or a song, I have to assume that there, at some point,  it becomes not strategy development or creativity but strategy implementation. Like there needs to be the songs are going to come in this order-- and I don't know much about music.  My musician friends are always laughing. RICK RUBIN: It's not so much about music. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. Well put, but the ordering of the sequence of the melodies, et cetera.  So at what point does one decide, OK, like now's the time to get into that more narrow focus of effort? Like we've got it. Let's run with this. Because there is a component of the creative process  that involves packaging and finishing. And is that part less satisfying to you, or is it just all part of the same larger arc? RICK RUBIN: It's all part of the same. It's nice. There's a good feeling. There's usually a good feeling when something is done.  On the one hand, it's a commitment, because up until the time that you say it's done, you can keep experimenting and changing it. If you think, well, maybe tomorrow I can make it better, then it's not finished.  And you keep thinking that for a long time, you can do that forever and never put out anything. So getting to the point where you're ready to sign off is a good feeling, and it allows you--  one of the things I talk about in the book is, because it is a difficult thing to do, because it's fun to play, and it's fun to maybe it's not the best it could be yet. To use whatever the next project is  going to be as motivation to finish the one you're working on now. Like I'm working on this. I'm spending all of my time on this thing. It's really good.  I believe it can be better, but there's this other thing that I really want to make. And if I keep tinkering with this one, I'll never get to make the other one. So using other projects as an impetus  to finish something and release it into the world is a good one. And you said your description of source is something within us. I don't know if I would say that was accurate.  It's definitely in us too, but it's not only in us. And it's I think of source as the organizing  principle of everything, and it's how everything exists. How the trees grow, and why there are mountains. And anything that we can see in the outside world,  and every discovery and every piece of art and every new design and every machine are all outgrowths of this source energy.  Our part of it is the antenna that connects to it, and maybe where the vehicle for source to allow things to happen in the world.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: And thank you for that, because I did indeed misspeak. Because I recall very distinctly in the book, you described how the physical world is constrained by the laws of physics and certain things. The imagination is unconstrained.  And I think I have this right, that you said the work set somewhere between those, it's neither of one nor the other. That ultimately what feeds into all of that are imagination and the way, indeed, that our brain is a physical entity.  The nature in the outside world provides at least what appears to be near infinite if not infinite options. And I love the example of the color palette. That if we restrict me to whatever  sorts of paints or medium I have, then it's restricted. But in nature, there's an infinite number of shades and tones and combinations. RICK RUBIN: And even on one, if you pick up a rock and look at the color of the rock  and tried to find a paint to match that rock, it would never match. There's too much. There are too many variations in nature  within a single color rock for us to get close. There's too much information. We scratch the surface. We're only scratching the surface. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And we love when  we are able to peer in at different scales, spatial scales, time scales too, but spatial scales, the delight that comes from that that these nature pictures-- seemed like there were more of these in the '80s, like where you'd see a drop of oil shot at very high resolution.  There's beauty in a drop of oil. And then you'd see the Earth and the galaxy, there's beauty in that too, these extremes. And of course, our daily perception is mostly through the filter of these kinds of interactions, walls, and sometimes outdoors.  There's a brilliant neuroscientist, and not surprisingly, he has a Nobel. His name is Richard Axel. He's at Columbia University. He's outrageous personality. Chews Nicorette nonstop.  You guys would get along great, not because of the Nicorette, but because his perspective on things is very abstract for a guy who's solved-- he won the Nobel for solving a great problem  within how we smell, perception of odors and tastes. And he says that everything that the brain does is an abstraction. Like I could take a photograph of your face and show it to you, and you'd say, yeah, that's me. Or let's say for the moment, I call myself an abstract artist.  Let's just play a game, because I've never been accused of being an artist. And I do three dots and a squiggly line, and I say that's you. And you say, well, that doesn't look like me, and I say, but that's my abstraction of you. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Well, the brain essentially does that, because or something in between that.  Because there's no actual photograph of you in my brain. It's just a bunch of neurons playing what we call an ensemble, like a different keys on a piano. And we go, Rick, I recognize you, Rick Rubin. And so everything is an abstraction,  and it's only once we start tinkering with the parts-- and this is the essence of science, to remove and add and manipulate. And the best example I can come up with would be Rothko. And I only we come up with this example because I started off in vision science and maybe this will make the most sense to everyone,  except the folks who've been blind since birth, and they can swap something in here. That if I show you a Rothko, and I don't tell you it's a Rothko, you may or may not actually think it's that impressive. It depends on your taste in art. But what Rothko did, which was amazing,  even if you don't like Rothkos-- and I happened to-- is that he removed all the white and high contrast-y stuff. And when you do that you alter color space, and so the colors look very different.  Some people saw that dress a few years ago, is it orange, or is a gold or whatever? That was a little bit of the same phenomenon. I doubt-- in fact, I'd be willing to bet my left arm that Rothko knew nothing about the neuroscience of color perception.  But somehow got to this place where, if there was no canvas showing and no high contrast and the paintings were large enough and on the appropriate wall, you saw them a certain way that tapped into something fundamental.  And this is where I think art and science really converge, is that, every once in a while, we see something that feels amazing to enough people-- and not just like the baggy pants phenomenon, not just because other people think it's cool.  But there's something there, and again this defies language. And I have to imagine that in your years of life and music and other creative endeavors, that every once in a while,  have you ever encountered something where something fundamental keeps showing up in different form? Or there's something like almost like a rule or a principle, does that ever come about? Because in science, we think of this  as like this is reveals something about our limitation to abstract the world. I hope I made that clear. RICK RUBIN: Not, exactly but I have a thought. You talked earlier about the drop  of oil, the photograph of the drop of oil and the photograph-- or we could use, on the other side, like Hubble telescope images of these vast things in high definition. What we see every day is as impressive as those things,  but where numb to them, because we see them all the time. And if we were to look at drops of oil every day in a microscope, a month from now, we would not find wonder in that image.  So sometimes, it's the novelty of not seeing it from that perspective before that's really thrilling. And I could imagine, and this probably  relates to the Rothko idea, that you could see something from a particular angle and have this magical experience. And then walk three feet to the side and see it from a different way, and it just evaporates.  It only works-- it only triggers this thing in us when we look at it just the right way. There was an experiment I just heard about,  heard about the other day, that sounds fascinating, that a painting teacher recommended. Where instead of painting-- having a model in the room and painting  the model, that you have the model in the next room. And you go into the next room without your equipment. You don't have your equipment, and you can study the model for as long as you want. And then you go into a different room,  where you can't see the model, and paint the model, instead of-- and it changes your relationship. We're not just painting the lines.  We're painting what is interesting enough about what I saw-- what are the data points that stuck in my mind? And when I string those together, what do I get?  And what do I-- how do I form it to get as close to whatever the experience of that person was, which the closest of getting to the experience  of that person in the painting might not look like a photograph. It might look more different then more the same  to really see what you see. If we think about the Picasso paintings that were inspired by African art, where the eyes are  on different levels, they may give us more information than a photograph would give us.  I'm thinking about when you were describing the sensation of when something takes your breath away, and we all have that when we see a dramatic sunset. Anyone you know, when there's a really dramatic sunset,  or if there's a whale, and if anyone's on the beach, and there's a whale, everybody's really interested that there's a whale. Do you know what I'm saying? These feelings of wonder, we get to experience them,  depending on where we are. Or a dragonfly or a bird flies into your space, these things happen. And when they happen, it's like we're confronted with the mystery of the world, when  we change the perspective. Normally, we don't think of whales in our backyard or birds in our house, flying freely, but they do happen. these things do happen, and they like break us out of our trance  when these things happen. It's like, oh, yeah, there are birds like this everywhere. I'm just not paying attention. This guy is coming in to tap me on the shoulder. It's like remember me? Here I am. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I would say that the whale example  and what you're describing is it's revealing to us how-- in a delightful way-- how deficient our perceptual filters normally are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a little bit like the Rothko is revealing how-- I've never thought about it this way until this moment--  is revealing to us how color normally looks is actually, first of all, not the only way it looks. Those colors we think are one way, but all of color-- this gets into the biology of color vision-- is all about contrast. What something is next to dictates what it looks like,  and that's the origin of that dress meme or whatever you call it. I still can't figure out exactly what a meme is. Someone will eventually tell me. In the same way, when you see a whale, and it's delightful, I think it's revealing to us the extent to which  those whales are-- the ocean is vast. There's a whole universe there, and we are blind to it all the time. And I think the misperception-- or the misconception, excuse me, is that we're delighted because we see the whale. We might be just as delighted because we're  getting hit with the contrast of how little we recognize all the time, and in that way, it reminds me a little bit about comedy. And I've been watching more comedy lately, and sometimes, it's the shock.  Sometimes, it's the absolute truth that's revealed, and then other times, what I've noticed-- and I saw Rogen do comedy at the Vulcan Club, in Austin, which he does every once in a while.  And it was small club, and he was leading out this story during his routine or bit, I think. Right? This bit, and everyone knew where it was going.  We all knew, and then when he finally told us, it was exactly where we thought it was going, and it was hilarious. RICK RUBIN: And it felt good. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it felt amazing, and I thought in that moment, I was like, wait a second, how did he pull that off?  That was masterful, because normally, it's this thing like you create one story. There's like a scripting out, almost like a courtroom lawyer. And then they kind of pull the curtain, and it's something different. And if you look at the science, the neuroscience, and brain imaging of laughter and humor, which  I've looked into, to be honest, and no disrespect to the people in that field, it's pretty lame. It's lame, because it's always the jarring nature of a surprise. But what he led us to was something that, oh, no, he's actually going there.  Oh, wait, he's really going there, and it was this anticipation with a beautiful delivery at the end. And so I'm convinced that, based on what we're talking about here, that there's something about when we see something, we think it's about that,  but that the delight that we feel could be about the other experiences that now become, in a subconscious way, like ha. It's almost like laughing at this perceptual deficit that we have.  It's almost like laughing at how little we actually know, which is what you've said. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. It could be that. It also could be the sense of community of when you think it's going to go a particular way,  and it goes that way. It's like reinforcement of you. It's like, yeah, he's saying it, but in a way, we're saying it together. I'm listening, he's saying it, but we're in this together,  and that's a good feeling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have to think about that for a second. I was trying to think about why certain music still can evoke such powerful emotions in me. And there does seem to be something special  about the music we listen to when we are teenagers. From about 14 until about 25, it seems to get routed into our nervous system in some way. Maybe because that phase of our life is really one of identity crisis.  You don't find too many 40-year-olds, some, who are wondering like who they are. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally, but almost every young teenager or pre-teen and is like who am I? You're defining personality. So I always likened it to that.  But leaving out the critical period biology stuff, what do you think it is about the music that we hear at that time? Are that much more emotionally tuned? Have we not shut down our sensors quite as much? Because the songs and the artists  don't matter, because they're very individual to me. For other people, it will be the Beatles or something. Now, I just really wish the Beatles did it for me too. But do you think that's important? Because I could see how it's really terrific. I could also see how it sets up one of these what I'll just use nerdy language  and call like a semi-deprived filter. Because if I'm only looking for the way that a Stiff Little Fingers track made me feel the first time I listened to it, when I was 15, the feeling is worthwhile. But if I'm looking for that, I'm missing all the other stuff. I'm missing the Beatles.  I'm missing Fleetwood Mac, which never did it for me either. I'm like, I'm missing all this stuff that people I love and respect really love. So I've never worried about it, because there's  an infinite treasure trove of other things that I do love. But I do sometimes wonder whether or not my life experience is diminished, because I'm not allowing range.

Punk is one thing. Hip hop is-- Neil Diamond too. Right? Eminem too, Slayer too, right? And in some sense, as I list these off,  just think about how much in high school, maybe nowadays less so, but even in college and as an adult, societally, were asked to constrain ourselves to one of these groups. I didn't know it was OK to love Bob Dylan  and love punk rock as much as I do, until I heard Tim Armstrong said he loved Bob Dylan. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I was like-- and recently, he told me he loves the Grateful Dead, and I was like, whoa. But I remember when you had to pick. RICK RUBIN: Both the Ramones and the Clash love the Beatles, so we can--  ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. I got work to do. RICK RUBIN: We'll do it together. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. RICK RUBIN: I have a feeling part of it is, the reason it gets in at that age, is it's a time when we're defining who we are,  and the music is part of the definition of how we see ourselves. Like the music that we hear before that might be the music that's on the radio or our parents' music or our older brother or sister's music. And then when you're 14 or 15, and you  start choosing what you're listening to, it's like, now it's finally mine. And my parents might not like it, and my older brothers and sisters may or may not like it, but this one is mine.  And it always has that impression in us that this is ours.  My that's my thought of why it continues to last. ANDREW HUBERMAN: How do you wipe the slate clean then? So for instance, if you're going to go in and work with somebody new-- and again, as people are hearing this, I hope that they're transplanting this to whatever it is that they do.  Because in the realm of science and podcasting and communication, it's not music, but there's a contour and a way. Hopefully, this podcast will look nothing like it does in five years. That's my hope, is it will still have the core features  of the beauty and utility of biology coming through, but I hope it doesn't look anything like episode two. RICK RUBIN: And I think it'll evolve as you evolve. It's just, the truer it is to what interests you,  and if you're not interested in biology in the same way in five years, I would hope it's not the same. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll be doing psychoanalysis in real time here. In therapy, we'll all be lying down on couches. RICK RUBIN: Whatever it is. Whatever it is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.

InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in getting regular blood  work done, for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test. The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors-- lipids and hormones and so forth-- but you don't know  what to do with those data. InsideTracker solves that problem and makes it very easy for you to understand what sorts of nutritional, behavioral, maybe even supplementation-based interventions you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers of those metabolic factors-- hormones,  lipids, and other things that impact your immediate and long term health-- to bring those numbers into the ranges that are appropriate and indeed optimal for you. If you'd like to try InsideTracker you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman and get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.  That's insidetracker.com/huberman to get 20% off. So how do you-- let's talk a little bit, if you would, because I know I'm very interested in your process. I'll spare you the daily routine question.  It's very cliche. But you and I are both lovers of sunlight, of horizons, and not as a trivial source, as an amazing gift of energy. Right?  And there aren't words for it really. Aside from your daily routines, when it comes to somebody you're going from project to project, and you know you're going to be doing work with somebody,  could be your own work. And we'll talk about the writing of this book and its structure which is very unique. I've never encountered a book with this kind of structure before, and it's the most facile read ever, and yet every single page, I underlined, took notes, starred.  And like, as you notice, it's very worn, very, very worn already and only more so over time. Do you have a process for removing the functions of the day and what you were doing last week  and what's going on in order to get more access to this-- I'm going to think of it now more as a receiver inside of you. Right? Almost like tuning a radio, [IMITATING STATIC] and then it comes in.  Like the beginning of like a Strummer Clash thing. Right? He love the radio. Joe loved the radio, right? [IMITATING STATIC] and then it comes in clear, and there it is. How do you clear the static? What are some of the operational steps  that you think might be more generalizable, regardless of where somebody in Africa is listening to this. RICK RUBIN: I would say, when I engage in a particular project,  whatever it is, I dedicate all of myself for that period of time, whatever it is. Whether it be 20 minutes or whether it  be five hours, whatever it is, total focus, and no outside distraction whatsoever.  And when I leave that process, I do my best not to think about it, when I'm away from it. I don't bring any materials with me. I don't leave the studio with works in progress and spend time listening to them during the day or looking for ideas.  I stay as far away from it, when I'm not directly engaging in it, as possible. And in the best of situations, I have something else to totally engage myself in in between.  So instead of working on project A for five hours, and then leaving and doing nothing, I'm hoping to engage in a Project B or B, C, and D with all of myself before going back to project A again, which might  be the next day, let's say. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So this relates to an amazing chapter and series of writings in your book, that I'm not going to describe, because I want people to find it for themselves, about disengaging, about disengaging from the process. One question I had as I read that chapter,  and as you're saying this now, is even though you're disengaged, do you believe that your subconscious is working it through? RICK RUBIN: I believe so. I believe so, and I think in general, to stew over a problem is not the way to solve a problem.  I think to hold the problems lightly-- and when I say a problem, when we're starting a project, there's usually this feeling of--  there's a question mark, at the beginning of every project. I'm always anxious when I start a new project, because I have no idea what's going to happen. I never know.  I never-- I may have, in some cases, a potential backup plan, if nothing works, but I really try not even to have that.  I prefer not to have that. I prefer to go in maybe to calm myself down enough to be able to show up, there'll be an idea of, if nothing works, maybe we could try something like this. But that would only be for my own anxiety.  It wouldn't be for actual practical use. But there's always a sense of anxiety, because I know, whatever's going to happen is completely out of my control.  Something either interesting or not will appear, and then we're going to follow that wherever it goes. And until something appears for us to follow,  I have a lot of anxiety, even though it has never not come. It has come every time, but there's something about it-- because I also feel like there might be expectation on me that I'm going to make it happen, and I know that's not happening. That's not how it works.  I show up ready for it to happen and am open to whatever we have to do to find that first thread. And once we find the thread, then it's like, OK,  we have a-- and that thread may lead us to anything. It could lead us in a million different directions. But something about having that glimmer, that we're not looking at a blank page.  We're looking at, OK, we have the beginnings of, I would say, a map. But it's a map that we don't know where it takes us, and it's just the beginning.  It's just like, you are here. If you have a map, and it says you are here, even if you can't see the directions, knowing where we are feels OK.  And once we get-- and usually, again, usually in the first day, first couple of days, it happens.  But up until then, it's really an anxiety-producing situation, and then I can't remember the original question. So that was the beginning of something completely different. But do you remember what you asked? I don't remember. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.  Well, we were talking about disengaging, and is your subconscious into it? And then we're talking about, I love this. So like what is your process of wading into this thing? And you're revealing that now.  I think of anxiety as readiness. I think about the characteristic features of anxiety, it tends to be a bit of a constriction of the visual field into more of a narrow vision. But that's appropriate, because you  want to shed what's going on elsewhere. And then even when people talk about the shakes or this like not feeling OK sitting still, anxiety was designed to mobilize us and not always to run away.  Rarely do I talk about the work in my own laboratory, but one of the things that-- frankly, I didn't discover but it was done in my laboratory but is brilliant. Graduate student Lindsey Salay, who's now at Caltech, was that we can often observe animals or humans  in very high states of anxiety, as they move forward toward a goal. And we always think of moving forward as like this calm thing, these heroes, Rosa Parks telling people like F you. Like I'm not getting off the back. I'm not leaving the--  giving up my seat on the bus or Muhammad Ali. I bet you they were experiencing tremendous anxiety, but it was in the forward tilt. And so I think anxiety is at least comfortable when we are forcing ourselves to stand still.  So it's a activating energy, and that brings up a word that I have written in my notebook as an extraction of a lot of themes from within the book that you and I have talked about before, which is-- and here I'm going to sound very West Coast woo.  But I mean it as seriously as it can be stated, that I feel like everything is energetic. We can do things from a place of anger. We can do things from a place of joy.  We can do things from a place of delight. I like to think maturing into the idea that joy and delight and love is the ultimate reservoir of energy. But a lot of the music that I like from when I was younger was because of the anger that was  thread into it or the sadness. RICK RUBIN: If you think of your relationship to that music, it's a relationship of love. You didn't listen to that to get angry. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: You listened to it because you loved it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I felt loved by it,  because it matched where I was at the time. RICK RUBIN: It was true to who you were and where you were. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I know that collaboration, there's a wonderful chapter on collaboration, but it's collaboration, as you mentioned before, with the universe, not with others.  But in terms of the, especially the kind of work that you've done and do, when it comes to working with artists, I do wonder-- and here I'm not looking for any gossip or stories. I've never been interested in gossip.  I love stories, but I'm not interested in gossip. But once you see that thread dangling there, and you're going to go after this. Or you grab on to it, and you're like, OK, now you have a little bit of a map and an orientation within that map.  I often wonder, scientists are complicated people. People think they're very boring, but they're actually very complicated. Because they're often living in one limited rule set of the prefrontal cortex. That's how you get good at getting degrees is by understanding the rules of academia  and playing by those rules. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People tinker with the rules. You get your Richard Axels who are very playful in how they go about it, but they are systematic. He's known for rigor, rigor, rigor. Right? When I think of creative artists and musical artists,  I think of a bit more zany or loose. Or you watch the documentary about the Ramones, and you're like, wow, there's all this chaos. How-- because so many of the brilliant artists, musical artists that are out there, seem to have some chaos inside them,  or their lives aren't always structured, oftentimes. And science too, by the way, there are substance abuse issues and personal life issues. How-- since you don't have 100% control, they need to play the instruments, sing, et cetera.  How do you work with people who have it in them but are getting in their own way? Right? And do you think that the internal chaos that a lot of artists seem to have,  do you think that sometimes is actually an essential piece of the creativity picture, that you can't disentangle it? RICK RUBIN: Yeah. I don't think it's an essential piece in general, but certain artists, that's how they do it.  I would say, I rarely get to see the chaotic part of artists. For whatever reason, they rarely show it to me, and most of them, like most comedians I know, are much more serious about what they're  doing than what it looks like from if you see them on stage. There's much more to it, and there's much more focus on craft going on and digging deep  than would necessarily be obvious seeing them jump around on stage. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm a fan of boxing, track and field and boxing, the sports nobody really cares about, now that UFC is so popular. And track and field is--  it's a little bit like wrestling. When you go, the people that are there are there because they really love it. We'll talk about wrestling in a little bit, professional wrestling. But Floyd Mayweather is obviously a colorful character and one of the best records in boxing of all time.  And a few years back, I got into watching his stuff, and what one sees is the cars and the money. They literally call themselves the money team, and the spending, and there's all the outrageous stuff.  But I know someone who was in camp with him who actually was a sparring partner for him, and the lore has it-- they have very closed door sparring or clean ups. But the lore is that he would do--  because nowadays, it's 12, three-minute rounds with a minute in between, used to be 15. But now, neuroscientists stepped in, and it turns out a lot of the deaths were occurring when it was more than 12 rounds. For whatever reason, cut off at 12 really seemed to truncate the deaths. There are other things too.  If the dad is apparently a cornerman-- we have someone else here at the podcast who knows more about this than me. RICK RUBIN: That's fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. The kid not wanting to disappoint the parent correlated with death. I'll get some of this wrong, and they can come after me.  But in any case, this guy who was in Floyd's camp said that he would do 30 to 60 minutes of sparring, bringing in fresh sparring partners with no rest. That he would run three or four times per 24 hour cycle,  despite all the critical need for sleep. That his training was unbelievably intense, to the point where he would just chew out, chew up, and destroy all training partners.  And yet the perception that we see is it's playful for him. So it sounds very similar. Like what we see is often not what goes into it, that people are intensely rigorous. RICK RUBIN: Yeah, and I think, in a way, from a psychological perspective,  if you knew you were fighting someone who wasn't taking it seriously, that would give you some confidence, and that would not be a good thing,  if the person was actually working really hard, outworking you. Do you know what I'm saying? Like from a psychological perspective, that makes sense to me. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So what I keep coming back to  is that I'm imagining in my mind you have to ends of the continuum. One that is about fairly narrow focus, training, training, strategy implementation, cultivating craft, building craft, and then the other side is the cloud. It's very nebulous. Right?  And there's this word that I learned from a colleague of mine, when I was down at the Salk Institute, when my lab was there, because he studies this. There's this phenomenon that I don't want to mispronounce, because then it sounds like something else.  But the correct pronunciation is pareidolia, and pareidolia is our tendency to look at an amorphous shape, like a cloud or a tree, and think that it looks like something else, an ice cream cone.  RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The man in the moon. RICK RUBIN: Yep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And that again reveals the extent to which the brain wants to place symbolic filters on things, and we need this. Right? Because I see you walk in the door, and Rick, I recognize you.  In fact, we have a brain area, called the fusiform face gyrus, that it literally is a face recognition area. And you could be at any orientation, or I could just see your eyes and know that it's you. There's a phenomenon called propasognosia, where people can see faces.  They can describe everything in the face, but they don't know, for instance, that it's JFK or Madonna or Lex Fridman. RICK RUBIN: It's quite the list. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite the list, there you go, Lex.  Run for office, Lex. Just kidding. It's hard enough to get you to respond to my texts as it is. So we have these filters, and so we're taking this cloud, and we're deciding what things are. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And what I want to go drill  into your process a little bit more deeply, when you approach a project-- so everyone meets each other, shakes hands. Here are the engineers. We're going to sit down. Everyone knows what they're doing, because you work with professionals.  And you start going, are you trying to be with the cloud or in the implementation? Like where are you in that continuum? And forgive me if I'm like trying to surgically go into your process in a way that would disrupt it in any way. But I trust you been doing this for a while,  and there's no threat of that. RICK RUBIN: I'm in the cloud, with the exception of I'm aware of what could go wrong on a technical side, and I might-- like if something good is happening,  I might look over and make sure that we're rolling. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's a leap over to here, momentarily, but then you get back. RICK RUBIN: Maybe. Maybe. If I feel like--  if I was in the moment, I would be in the cloud. And if something good starts happening, it would trigger something in me. Like uh-oh, I hope this is-- I hope we're really doing this, because I don't know  if we could ever do this again. That would be a thought of-- when the first time the real world would come into the picture would be something good is happening. Let's not lose it.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: And when that happens, do you-- never been in a studio besides a podcast studio. Do you say, hey, guys, that sounded good. More of that. Or do you wait, you let them continue? Because obviously you don't want to break their flow. RICK RUBIN: We'd never want to break any flow,  once it's happening. Yeah. Once something's happening, just sit back and watch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And do you think there's resonance, like the team of engineers and other people know when \"It,\" quote, unquote, is happening? RICK RUBIN: If everyone's paying attention, yes.  When everyone's paying attention, it's usually pretty obvious. Sometimes, the thread will be something different than expected, and maybe not everybody would pick up on it. And that might be a particular-- that might be particular based on my taste or an artist's taste.  Or someone involvement might say, let's listen back to that. I think that was better than we thought. That can happen. You said several things, and it was  like you said enough for there to be several conversations. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I tend to do that. Sorry. Especially with you. I don't get to see you nearly as often as I would like, and so when I do, I confess that I'm a little bit of a kid in a candy shop. RICK RUBIN: I wrote down the brain tells us stories.  So you talked about, I walk in, certain data points, you recognize me, but it's a real like looking at a cloud shorthand. We go through our lives doing this all day  with everything we see, and the short hand, in the case of me, you know me, the shorthand turns out to be right. It checks out. If it's something we don't know and something  we're not familiar with, something happens, we experience something on the street. Something happens, and it doesn't make sense. Something out of the ordinary happens.  The first thing is this doesn't make sense. Then, what we do is, again, subconscious, unconsciously-- I don't know if it's unconscious or subconsciously-- without thinking, we create a story that explains what just  happened, a hypothetical that makes it OK that what just happened happened. And oh, maybe he's running because his dog ran away, and he's chasing his dog. Maybe that's why he's running.  And as soon as we have that thought of what it might be, we relax, because now it's not just a guy running, and this is weird. But it's a guy running, oh, he's probably running after his dog.  And now, we register that story that we just made up, without even knowing we were making it up, as what happened. And then later in the day, if someone says, yeah, did you see that guy running out of the house?  It's like, yeah, he was chasing his dog. I saw that. And you won't even realize that it was maybe hypothetical story that was the first possible explanation that allowed you to continue walking. Do you know what I'm saying?  That's our whole lives. Our whole lives are reacting to things, making up a story of what we think may have happened, without realizing that's what we're doing. And then living the rest of our lives as if that thing  that we made up really happened, and we never know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I completely agree. We confabulate from birth until death. There's this well-observed phenomenon  in people who have memory deficits. So there's the sad example of this and then there's the everyday typical not-- who knows-- sad or not sad example. So for instance, if somebody has a slight memory deficit, or someone has Alzheimer's dementia, they'll find themselves in the hallway at night and say,  what are you doing here? And they'll say, oh, I was going to get a glass of water, but they're walking away from the direction that would make sense. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: People who-- alcoholics who drink enough develop something called Korsakoff syndrome, where a certain brain area gets messed up.  And you'll ask them a question, like oh, what are you doing here? And they will come up with incredible stories, sometimes interesting stories, that have no bearing on reality. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You ask them who their name is-- RICK RUBIN: But do they believe? They believe that's what happened. ANDREW HUBERMAN: With 100% certainty, and this  actually relates to a lot of the now better understood controversy around repressed memories. You can, especially from young people, you can pull memories from them of things that never happened. This has been demonstrated over and over again. So courtrooms know to be very cautious now  about this whole notion of repressed memories. RICK RUBIN: That's good to know. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, very, very complicated area of the law, as you can imagine. Because we tend to want to trust victims, for understandable reasons. But in terms of accuracy of details,  two people have very different accounts of the same experiences, and this has been shown over and over again. That you can do well in the laboratory. It's pretty interesting. So again, because of this selective filtering and storytelling, and we are-- I think it was Salman Rushdie, who  said we are the storytelling species. He probably-- RICK RUBIN: Wow. I was going to say we're storytelling machines, but that's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. We are story-- I would say that the big five, if I had to pick up a brain function, is we are very limited filters.  The mantis shrimp sees 67 shades of red for every one that we see. So they have access to things we don't have access to. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They're not, as far as I releasing, albums of the Red Hot Chili Peppers caliber, but who knows. Maybe down there they are.  I did see something, by the way as a relevant tangent recently, and I don't know if it's-- look, even if it's crazy, it's super cool. If you take a device that amplifies the electrical signals coming from cactus,  and you just translate that into a simple rule of conversion to two or three pitches of sound, the music that comes out of it is beautiful, nothing short of beautiful. And when I saw that, the teenager in me thought, you know when we hear whale song, we think it's so beautiful.  Like what if they're just like cursing at each other the whole time? Right? Maybe they're in there like a Rogen episode, when he invites all his comedian friends in there. Who knows? Maybe it's a psychoanalytic conversation about their childhood traumas. I don't know. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But we decide, whale song is beautiful.  RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We decide cactus are just plants. RICK RUBIN: And it's beautiful to us, and we're right, that it is beautiful to us. But it doesn't mean we know anything about it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's right. Yeah. So we have these filters, perceptual filters.  We only can see and hear, smell and taste what we can, and then the brain likes to work in symbols. We tend to like to match that person whose shoes are messed up must be homeless. I've had a couple of instances in life  where I saw what I thought was a homeless vagrant inside a building at an academic institution. It turned out, it was the most accomplished person in the field. That's always cool. Yes, that happened at Berkeley.  Then, the other thing that we do is we tend to put symbol-- so we said perception, symbol representations, and then our memories are entirely confabulated,  based on already deficient symbol and perceptual representation. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And so I never liked the statement that we don't know how the brain works. I think we do know how the brain works, but that it works through very limited filters. RICK RUBIN: Yes.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: So knowing that and accepting it, and it seems to me that this idea of looking to nature, looking outside us, is so critical.  And in fact, I hope you won't mind me sharing this, but a few years back, I had sent you something by text. And I was kind of in disbelief about something I had seen in the media. I was like, they got it all wrong. And I knew the person involved, and it was not a good situation for them.  And I was like, they got it all wrong, and you wrote back. You said, it's all lies. Back to nature, the only truth. RICK RUBIN: Wow. That's wild. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I wrote that down. I put it over my desk. RICK RUBIN: Wow.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I still-- I'd tattoo it on my forehead, if I didn't already have it well-committed to memory. But I know that's true. Right? Nature we can look at and it's-- RICK RUBIN: When I say it's all lies,  you just talked about our ability to how limited our facility to see and understand what we see. Yes? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes.  RICK RUBIN: So based on that, that leads us to we can't know much. Do you know what I'm saying? Our resolution is so low on everything  that we're really just like we're grasping at straws. We have no idea. We have no idea, and there's great power and knowing that.  Because if you think you know what's going on, chances are, you're being deceived. Not because somebody is deceiving you, but because they're telling you what they see, and they don't know. It's all-- do you know what I'm saying?

They emphasize that they look forward and are not attached to the past, suggesting a forward-focused mindset without the emotional anchors that come with reminiscing.", "Answer 11": "The discussion revolves around the complexities of music appreciation and personal identity, highlighting how societal norms often pressure individuals to conform to specific music genres. The speakers express their love for a diverse range of music and reflect on how music serves as a personal identifier, especially during formative years. They also explore creative processes, including the balance between structured and chaotic elements in artistic work and the importance of disengagement from projects to stimulate subconscious creativity. The conversation touches on broader themes in psychology, storytelling, and how perceptions can be limited by individual experiences and biases."}, "Evolution Answers Type 2 by gpt-4o-mini": {"Score 1": "{\"Score\":9}", "Score 2": "{\"Score\":10}", "Score 3": "{\"Score\":8}", "Score 4": "{\"Score\":9}", "Score 5": "{\"Score\":8}", "Score 6": "{\"Score\":7}", "Score 7": "{\"Score\":10}", "Score 8": "{\"Score\": 8}", "Score 9": "{\"Score\":8}", "Score 10": "{\"Score\": 9}"}, "Evolution Answers Type 2 by gpt-4o": {"Score 1": 0, "Score 2": 0, "Score 3": 2, "Score 4": 10, "Score 5": 0, "Score 6": 2, "Score 7": 0, "Score 8": 10, "Score 9": 4, "Score 10": 0}}, "Sample 15": {"Audio_path": "audio_benchmark/ycOBZZeVeAc_4.wav", "Context": " It's all made up. Everything we know is made up. Maybe, maybe it's true. This brings us to pro wrestling. It's the reason that pro wrestling is closer to reality than anything else we can watch  or any other content. It's we know it's made up. We know that it's a performance. It's storytelling, and that's how everything  is, except we think wrestling is fake, and the world is real. Wrestling's real, and the world's fake. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You talk about in the book-- we're definitely going in this direction. In the book, you talk about this notion of entertaining  the idea of the opposite being true. And there are not only emerging but established fields of psychology that are making great ground, I think, into the human psyche, Byron Katie's work and others. Where you take a statement, and you start playing with that statement.  You poke at its authenticity. And when I first heard that, I thought, this is hokey. Right? It's just words. And then I realized how foolish I was being, because she's really on to something. And there are others too, of course, but in science,  that's exactly what you do. You don't really ask questions in science. You are forced to raise hypotheses and try and say true or false. Now, there are limitations to that approach, certainly. Pure observational studies have been  incredible in terms of what they've revealed to us, especially in medicine. A patient that has a bullet hole through a certain area of the brain, you don't go in and say, oh, I hypothesize that person will have a deficit in seeing faces. No. The person wandered into the clinic, and they go,  this person sees faces but can't make sense of them. And then you reverse-- you forensically arrive at an understanding. So but in general, we go about things in this way,  and considering that the opposite might be true, well, that's a little bit, I suppose, of like seeing the whale at the surface of the water. It's like, well, the opposite of my experience, which is all above water, for the most part,  is maybe not the complete experience of life. You start seeing the inverse all the time. So I want to-- RICK RUBIN: Consider the inverse all the time, and it really relates to the way that you described how we see colors is based on contrast.  So maybe blue is only blue in relation to yellow. So if blue is our choice, if we're not considering yellow, blue doesn't exist. Do you know what I'm saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely.  RICK RUBIN: It's like, we talk about night. It's only night, because there's day. If there was no day, there is no night. In all of our cases, it's like the yin yang. There's the light and the shadow always.  There's always another side for everything, and we focus on one aspect. But if we look at the other aspect, chances are, we'll learn something too. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The nervous system  is not just able to do this. It's the way it does everything. Two experiments I'll just briefly describe. My scientific great grandparents, David Hubel, Torsten Wiesel, showed that, if you force a person to look at something for a long period of time without moving their eyes--  there's a way that you can do this-- the image disappears. Because normally, your eyes are making little microsecods, and you're comparing what you're seeing to what's right next to it. Pixel by pixel, pixel by pixel, pixel by pixel. RICK RUBIN: Wow. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We don't even have to use the example of pressing on the arm. We're sitting in chairs right now,  and until I said you know what's going on at the level of sensation on the backs of your thighs, you were unaware of it. Because if you experience a pressure or a smell in a room, you ever walk in the smell is either good or not good, pretty soon, the smell disappears.  The neurons are still firing like sledgehammers on a bell, but we become blind and deaf to it. Because the nervous system likes to habituate the value of that signal when it's there often, and it's only the stuff that comes through  signal the noise that kind of jolts us into attention and awareness. And I want to return to attention awareness, which are prominent themes in the book. And I think, in an important way, not just, oh, attention awareness is important,  but you also give insight into how to pay better attention, how to pay awareness with the understanding that people are going to go about it differently, but I do want to ask you about wrestling.  Because when I was growing up, I lived South of the Cow Palace, and there was some wrestling going on there. I think back then it was WWF. There was a short stint in my childhood where I paid attention to, in particular,  was it Koko B. Ware, the guy that had a Macaw? I was obsessed with tropical birds, and he would come in, and he put his tropical bird on the thing. And then George \"The Animal\" Steele, the guy that would eat the ring. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. So and-- RICK RUBIN: I believe he was a professor. Seriously.  Seriously. Seriously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was he really? RICK RUBIN: In real life. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing. RICK RUBIN: He was a professor, but he played Georgia \"The Animal\" Steele as a wrestler. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And I loved the movie The Wrestler, The Wrestler. RICK RUBIN: Darren Aronofsky movie. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was Mickey Rourke. RICK RUBIN: With Mickey Rourke. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.  One of the reasons I liked it is I once visited Asbury Park. Isn't that where that was filmed? There's a vacant-- he goes to visit his daughter. There's a vacant amusement park or abandoned amusement park scene there that was really eerie, still kind of haunts me a little bit.  There's something about the East Coast in fall. All the places that people normally go just for the summer, that we don't have out here in the West coast, people in the East Coast are just tougher than we are. It still haunts me. Great movie.  But I remember watching wrestling, and it was at that age, I think I was probably about 12, 13, maybe 11, 12, 13, where you're entering puberty,  and puberty is a fundamental landmark of development. It's the most rapid period of aging. It's also when we start to change our rule set. Like certain people and certain kinds of interactions take on profoundly different meaning. Right?  It's not just a reproductive competence time, and when kids, their bodies change. The rulebook changes fundamentally. RICK RUBIN: Our understanding of the world changes in that moment. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. The moment that a child understands really what sex is  and how they got there and that a lot of the stuff that we see in the world is kind of passively, or not so passively, being sent through that filter, it's like it's something. It changes the rule book of perception.  I view this age, from about 11 to 13, at least for me was a unique transition point. Where the gap between what I perceived as reality and fiction was blurry.  This is captured pretty well in that movie \"Stand By Me,\" where they're hanging around the campfire at night. And the kid says, who do you think would win in a fight between Superman and Mighty Mouse? And the other kid says, like you idiot, Mighty Mouse is a cartoon.  Of course Superman would win. And like to me, that's being 11 and 1/2 or 12 years old. Where your understanding of reality as you know it is changing, but it's not completely crystallized into an adult form reality.  RICK RUBIN: That sounds like a really healthy place to be, to me, like that. Not letting it crystallize, I think there's where the downfall happens. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So I have a question specifically about wrestling, but it's really about process.  RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I want to know whether or not you watch wrestling because it allows you to access the energy state in your body and mind and that mode of thinking in which  reality, as one conceives it, is somewhat blurry. Or is it for a number of other reasons, which is fine. Is that the energy you're trying to export and bring  to the creative process elsewhere, to life? Is it that anything is possible, or that we're dealing with archetypes? Because it doesn't matter if it's Koko B. Ware or Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage, or George \"The Animal\" Steele and the lovely Elizabeth.  I guess I did watch a little bit of wrestling. They are archetypes, much like the Greek myths or the Bible or-- no disrespect to the Bible or to Greek myths or to wrestling, for that matter. Archetypes are a powerful filter for humans,  but we know that they're a very limited filter too, because people aren't built like square wave functions. We have curves and contours and complexity. So what is the deal with your relationship to wrestling?  RICK RUBIN: I think it maintains that playfulness. Anything is possible. We expect the unexpected all the time in wrestling.  And it's a way to have a feeling of the energy of a sport with no competition. Everyone is working together to put on the best show they can.  So it's more like a ballet than it is like a sporting event, and there's great skill involved. It's one of the few things that I can watch and really feel relaxed. It relaxes me.  I don't feel like I have to think about it. I can just relax and enjoy it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This brings up a topic that is very near and dear to my heart, which is this notion of dopamine schedules. I never want to reduce everything to dopamine, but dopamine is the universal currency of delight, pleasure,  motivation seeking. There are other chemicals involved too, but there's a beautiful experiment and a couple of examples that I'll use as a foundation to more questions about wrestling and why it's powerful.  And why other people may want to use wrestling or some other endeavor as a way to access creative energy and source. Earlier, we talked about you can train an animal to press a lever three times and then get reward,  and it will learn three is the magic number for reward, and then it can switch. It takes a little bit of training, and then they can switch. But they can't do prime numbers. They can't do high abstraction schedules. Humans either. We're not very good at figuring out the rule set  for optimal foraging. We do it well enough to persist as a species, at least for now, but it's very likely that we are not tapping into that system as well as we could, and how would we know, if we don't know?  It's one of those you who don't know what you don't knows. There's a beautiful experiment that explored when dopamine is released in the context of watching sport or watching comedy, believe it or not. And with the comedy stuff, it was every time there was a surprise, it was kind  of that jarring like ha-ha, and they'd measure people's dopamine output. They were also brain imaging. In a game of basketball, it's a beautiful opportunity experimentally. Because every time one team gets the ball or is shooting free throws or something, they're going down court, and it's either  going to end up in the basket, or it's not. Might end up on the free throw line, but it's end up or not. So what they found is that the schedule of anticipation was every time there was a switch of which team got it. So you're waiting, waiting, and then it's, ah. You're waiting, waiting. Yes. Waiting, waiting, three-pointer.  Ah, awesome, and if something happened where it looked like they were going to make the three-pointer, but then somebody basically swatted the ball away, and then went for a half court shot, like you don't expect that very often, bigger dopamine release. So that's kind of how the dopamine thing works.  When you describe wrestling, I wonder, because you don't know the script, it's not one team gets it, then the other team gets it. You don't know who's going to win. Anything could happen is what you said. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The availability  of that dopamine surge or drip, which is a powerful thing, is completely-- it's completely out of your reach in terms of anticipation. You don't know when it's going to come,  but it must arrive often enough that you return to it 11 hours a week of watching. In many ways, the way I'm starting to conceptualize the creative process is a little bit the same. You don't know where those nuggets of gold  and those loose threads are, but you have enough experience-- and in this case, I am referring to you specifically-- to know that they are in there. The people walking in this room have a certain level  of ability and talent to create that the map will form itself, as we are going through the voyage. And those nuggets of-- here I'm calling them dopamine-- but they  are out there, and that knowledge is enough to get you to come back again and again to trust the process. So I actually think the way you described wrestling as it's the energy of the sport.  It's not whether or not it's this move or that move or who wins or who loses. It's the energy, and I'm guessing it's the energy that it creates in you as an observer. RICK RUBIN: Yes. It's the energy creates in me, and the reality  that it's honest in what it is, in a world where seemingly nothing is honest at what it is. And again, not because people are lying all the time.  We have little data, we make up a story to explain it, and then we say that's what happened. And we have trusted sources who do exactly what I just  described and who pass this down as gospel of what we teach. And maybe it's true, and maybe it's not.  With wrestling, we know, maybe it's true, maybe it's not. We lean towards it not being true, but what's really interesting about wrestling, and maybe one of the most fun things about it,  is that, sometimes, real life works its way into the story. Like two wrestlers get married. Now-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: In real life. RICK RUBIN: Well, we don't know. It's like you never know.  It's like in the storyline, they're getting married or getting divorced, or best friends turn on each other. And it could be part of the story,  and it could really be happening, because they do. Right? Someone gets someone breaks their leg. So they're out, because their leg is broken. Did they break their leg? We don't know. They're out. Do you know what I'm saying? We're told they broke their leg.  So there's always this like I wonder what's true? I wonder where the line is. We know that it's scripted and/or predetermined. That's how they say, it's predetermined.  But we don't know where reality is and isn't, and in some ways, that's our real experience of the world, is this we don't really know where reality is and isn't.  We have an idea, maybe. I think in some ways, wrestling's more honest or legitimate, because we start with the idea that it's fixed. When we go to a boxing match, we don't go to a boxing match thinking it's fixed.  Yet, it might be, and historically, it's happened. Or there was just something in baseball where-- was it baseball? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I don't follow baseball. I should know. RICK RUBIN: It was just a big sports--  ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. RICK RUBIN: One of the teams that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: The plays, basically. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Was it the call signals of the-- RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Of the catcher? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. You're not supposed to deprogram the-- or deconstruct the call signals of the other team,  and I guess maybe a team got caught doing that. RICK RUBIN: Yes, and the team that won whatever the World Series was. So it's like, with wrestling, that wouldn't be a scandal. Do you know what I'm saying? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Almost anything goes.  RICK RUBIN: Anything goes, and that's what the world is really like. So in some ways, it's comforting, and there's still this mystery of like, wow, I wonder if that's true or not, because we never really know. If someone gets hurt, did they really break their back,  or are they just going on vacation? We don't know. We'll never know. It's fascinating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is fascinating, and I feel like there are certain people who show up in a way that is surprising in not just one direction but in all directions. Like it's one thing for a celebrity  to come out and make a statement. That can be interesting or not interesting, depending on the celebrity and the statement and the delivery. And I'm probably going to get this wrong, because I'm terrible at pop culture things, most of them anyway.  But as I recall, Lady Gaga showed up to some event wearing an outfit made of meat, and I can't tell you for the life of me whether or not that was a statement against meat or for meat. Maybe, it was a statement for the carnivore diet. Maybe, it was a statement for veganism.  I don't know. RICK RUBIN: Or maybe neither. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or maybe neither, but it was definitely a statement in that it broke with the norm. And it said to me, OK, she creates different rules  for herself or breaks boundaries that other people had. I never heard of anyone doing that before. It doesn't mean they hadn't, but I never heard of anyone doing it before.  But we do tend to associate outside the current playbook with, quote, unquote, creativity, unless it crosses a line, in which case, it becomes something else.  It becomes almost theater for sake of theater. But what you're telling me is that, within the realm of wrestling, theater is the goal, at some level, and everybody knows it who goes into those arenas, who watches it. RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody. RICK RUBIN: Yes.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: And everyone agrees to kind of suspend outside reality and say this is reality. RICK RUBIN: Yes, and they boo for the bad guys and cheer for the good guys, knowing that backstage they're probably friends. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Except for the kids  that are 11, who think it's really real. RICK RUBIN: I don't know. I don't even know if they know. I'm not sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The only other person I know who has vocalized their love of professional wrestling to the extent that you have is Lars Frederiksen, the rhythm  guitar player for Rancid who loves wrestling. But his statement-- and forgive me, Lars, if I'm getting this wrong-- is that, because he grew up in an area of the South Bay, where there were no teams. Like now, there's the San Jose Earthquakes, but there was no football team in San Jose. He's from Campbell.  But there were no like good teams, no sports teams, but they had wrestling, and he had it where? On the television set. And so if you didn't have a-- like I didn't grow up with any organized sports thing.  The 49ers were up the road, but for me, it was skateboarding, and I love it for the same reason. You actually never really know what's going to happen. There is no rulebook. The rulebook is made up, but they are very-- it's a unique sport, in that--  surfing's a bit like this too-- in that, they are absolutely maniacal about making things look a certain way. It's not about just doing it. It's about doing it and making it look good. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Smooth, catching it  with the front foot, and the trends change. RICK RUBIN: Styles. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style. RICK RUBIN: It's a style. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Style, and that style is this like nebulous thing of like in fashion or in sports. Right. Whereas with a football, there's some amazing catches. There's even like the catch, which I happen to know  is a 49er-- the catch during the Super Bowl. But in general, it's like the goal is get in the end zone, win the game. And I'm sure football players are like cringing as I say this, but it doesn't matter if you run ugly, if you run fastest. In skateboarding, that would never fly.  In fact, you'd basically be ridiculed out of the sport. In wrestling, is it the same? Are there style to wrestling? RICK RUBIN: It's all performance. It's all the charisma of the people involved.  There's the physical ability, the ability to talk and tell a story, and how charismatic the performers are. Whether you want to watch them, whether you want to see them win, whether you want to see them lose,  and whether you're interested in cheering or booing for them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was going to say it reminds me of opera, but operas get released over and over again. You know the story and how it ends when you walk in, if you've listened to it before.  So wrestling does seem to be unique in that way. It's real time iteration, at least from the perspective of the-- RICK RUBIN: And it's real time iteration based on because people get hurt all the time. They're doing really crazy physical stuff.  So if someone gets hurt, the story has to change. Because in real life, they can't show up next week and do what was planned in the script. So it's very alive, and there's a lot of--  something interesting and unexpected is always happening. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, in a much more calm form, I'll share with you something, I'd just like your perspective on it.  For years, I used a tool in order to try and access ideas, since I was a little kid actually, because I have a little bit of OCD, a little bit of a Tourette's. When I get tired, I'll do that.  I'm very strategy implementation oriented. I had that when I was a little kid, I needed all my stuffed animals arranged in a certain way. LEGOs had to be-- a little neurotic or a lot. And then science is very much about you have to do things with a lot of precision.  And I discovered that the ultimate reset for me when I was in graduate school or a postdoc if I couldn't make it to a really good agnostic front show, or like chaos. The chaos of a punk rock show for me was this reset. It was to release all this thing.  And I got energy from it. First time I saw Transplants play, it's was, whoa, because you don't know what's going to happen. And it was scary. And I loved it. The other thing that I used over time to reset this ability to think in a structured way  without it feeling like it was overcoming me, maybe even access the same thing in some ways that you're accessing with wrestling was I like to stare at aquaria. I like to go to aquariums or I'd build aquariums. And I would just sit there because you never know which way the fish are going to go. You think it's going that way, but then all of a sudden  they'll turn and go the other way. It's completely unpredictable. And I love aquaria because of the tranquility and had them in my lab for a long time. I just adore aquariums because of the non-linearity of it.  It's not A, B, C. It's A, Z, Z, Q. And I think this is what some people try and access through psychedelics, but that didn't seem to me like a very good way to do it on a regular basis,  whereas with aquaria, the tanks are there. So in your book, you talk about something that I also share a love for, which is how the ocean and aspects of nature like clouds and ocean,  they have a predictability to them. We know where they are and where to find them. Fortunately, the sun rises and sets every day, at least for now. And we can count on them with 100% reliability.  And yet, they are from the perspective of what physicists would say, they're very chaotic. You can't look at a wave and know exactly how the foam is going to roll out. You know it's going to roll in and roll out. We have the tides, but when I hear about wrestling, I think about my love of aquaria.  And I think about my love of punk rock music, for instance, or I think about the ocean. I think in that way that we actually have a need to source from things that have both a combination of structure and no structure.  RICK RUBIN: I think it's interesting that there are some places that don't change and some places that change a lot. And I can remember thinking about this. I was walking-- there's a beach that I walk on in Hawaii, that I walk on every morning when I'm there.  And if you walk on the same beach every day, you get a sense of what it's like. And I remember I was in Hawaii. I walked on the beach every day for a year or however long it was. And then I left for six months, then I came back. And the next time I walked on the beach,  it was an entirely different beach, entirely different. And I remember thinking in that moment like this is an unusual place because I pictured  the house that I didn't even grow up in, the house I lived in maybe for the first seven years of my life. And I think about what the backyard looked like.  And I think about a particular old tree that was there. And I don't know this for sure, but my sense is, if I were to go back to where I grew up, and go to that place, and look in that yard, it would probably look pretty similar.  Yet, here was this beach that I was walking on in Hawaii that in the course of six months completely changed its face. And just how interesting both of those things are. And that depending on the project  we're working on, to be able to go to a place that we know has the potential to change a lot and what that would do to our connection with the Earth  when we're experiencing that versus going to a place that has very little change. And you can count on it being the way it's always been. That both of those are interesting things  to be able to draw upon depending on what we want to open in our psyche. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I have an almost unhealthy fascination with New York in the mid '80s and '90s. RICK RUBIN: You didn't live there, though.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but since I was a kid-- I went there when I was a little kid. And I was fascinated by it. There's also a very interesting migration of East Coast to West Coast creatives, including yourself, that played an important part in my life just seeing things and hearing things  that were meaningful to me. But I, for instance, I love the movie-- I haven't seen the documentary about Jean-Michel Basquiat, Basquiat, because of the characters that are in it, and the huge number of people in that like Parker Posey, Dennis Hopper, and Christopher Wall, and on, and on.  Those images of New York at that time are so exciting and what was happening. I wish I could transplant myself to that. If I had a time machine, that's where I'd land first. I hear a lot of people say, New York isn't what it used to be.  San Francisco isn't what it used to be, whatever. LA isn't what-- there does seem to be something that feels a little bit disruptive to people about cities changing. But the idea that natural landscapes change is actually--  we even accept like, hey, fires sweep through places. And assuming they weren't started by humans, we accept that. That change and the reordering of landscapes is normal and healthy. And I always tell myself, you have the kids growing up in New York, or San Francisco, or Chicago now.  They only know it that way. So to them, it's as cool or as uncool as it's ever going to be. They either want to get out or they're loving every piece of it. And this happened for all the people that came before us. So my question is a very basic one. Do you miss the New York that you came up in?  Are you somebody who is attached to the past? RICK RUBIN: I'm not attached at all. I'm not attached to anything in the past. I don't look back at all. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You don't think about, oh, in my dorm room at NYU, Beastie Boys, this. I miss-- no. Your optics are forward, present and forward.  RICK RUBIN: Only present and forward. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there a process to that or it just happens to be where you default to? RICK RUBIN: I don't know. I'm not sure, but that's how I do it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia is not in Rick Rubin's brain.  RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man. RICK RUBIN: No. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I say that with genuine admiration. So you can hear a song that maybe you had a role in producing or not, something from the past.  And you're accessing a state, presumably, but you're not pining for wishing how it was. RICK RUBIN: Never. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm no psychologist, but I'm going to venture to say that I think that's a very unique quality.  I think a lot of people wish for or wish that things did not happen the way they did, that there's a lot of living in the past. There's a lot of this notion of people future trip. I don't actually think that's the default state of the brain.  I think a lot of people live in emotional anchors to the past, good and bad. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. I have none. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And watching wrestling is one way that you cleanse the palate. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When you go to a meal and you-- they pass around this or that--  I don't know if they do this anymore, but pass around a little bit of sorbet to cleanse the palate. It turns out there's a biological reason for that. There's a kind of neutralization of the taste receptors between savory, and sweet, et cetera. So wrestling is your palate neutralizer. RICK RUBIN: I know that if I watch  wrestling before I go to sleep, it's going to be a good night's sleep. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you dream about wrestling? RICK RUBIN: No, never. But it's just relaxing. It's just relaxing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you anticipate  when you watch it, like here comes the dopamine hit? RICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes when it happens it's exciting.

ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do they actually get hurt sometimes? You said they do. RICK RUBIN: A lot, often. They do. I mean, they're basically stunt men. So imagine stuntmen getting hurt doing a crazy stunt. It happens all the time. ANDREW HUBERMAN: When the movie The Wrestler,  I remember he got staples stapled into him. And I thought that's pretty intense. I once went and saw-- I guess they called it Mexican wrestling. I don't know if they call it that anymore, where the guys dip their hands-- RICK RUBIN: Lucha libre. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, they dip their hands in glass. This was in Sacramento. And I once saw it. I honestly didn't have a stomach for it.  I really didn't. I couldn't believe it was legal. It might not have been legal. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But I thought-- RICK RUBIN: There's crazy stuff in wrestling sometimes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow. So before sleep, is that typically when you watch wrestling? RICK RUBIN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you think it's useful for people  to have some activity that allows them to clear their mind and create peace before heading off to sleep? RICK RUBIN: I think so. And I think yoga nidras would be good. It's like yoga nidra, pro wrestling, any of those type things.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not watching the Dahmer thing. I won't watch that. RICK RUBIN: I don't watch any horror, anything, or I don't like violent things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I know it exists. I know horrible things happen in the world, but I certainly don't want to do that before sleep.  I think these liminal states before and emerging from sleep are very powerful. When you wake up in the morning, are your thoughts immediately structured or do you enjoy the clearing of the clouds? RICK RUBIN: It's a slow process for me to wake up.  And I like that. I like not engaging too much too soon. I usually fall asleep listening to a lecture or something  speaking because if I don't, I can get caught in my own thoughts. And listening to something is enough of a focus point that it stops me from talking to myself.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: I do the same. My grandfather listened to the radio, to sports on the radio. And he would fall asleep. Oftentimes, he was a smoker with a cigarette in his mouth. His wife's responsibility was to stay up later than he did to make sure he didn't burn everything  down. And then when you wake up, you said it's a slow process. Is it an hour or two before you feel like you're-- RICK RUBIN: I would say probably an hour. I usually wake up and try to get in the sun  as soon as I possibly can and hope to spend-- hope to spend about an hour. And then I'll usually go for a walk on the beach for another hour or 90 minutes, depending.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you with family members and other people at that time? RICK RUBIN: No, I'm usually focused by myself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Phone? RICK RUBIN: I'll be listening to something. I don't look at the phone, but I listen to, again, a lecture, or podcast, or audiobook.  I like audiobooks a lot. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I do too. If an idea comes to mind do you write it down? RICK RUBIN: I may, it depends. I like to. I usually have-- would do a note in my phone. I don't usually carry pen and paper with me when I'm walking.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I do the same. I do a long Sunday hike or jog. And I will audio script into my phone. People sometimes give me funny looks because I'm talking to myself. RICK RUBIN: That's a nice way to do it, though. I'd like to learn more of the audio methods of doing it  instead of the typing methods. Right now I type and I don't think it's the best way. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The voice memos function in the iPhone and other phones is really good. And there are now companies like rev.com  that will turn those into Word docs scripts that are fairly well corrected, fairly inexpensive. No, they're not a sponsor of the podcast. I just happen to use it. It's great. I actually learned that trick from Richard Axel,  the Nicorette chewing, wild man, Nobel Prize winner. He writes manuscripts by walking around his office, pacing, and talking into his phone. RICK RUBIN: I always think of the Woody Allen movie  where the Alan Alda character is talking about-- yeah, he's speaking comedy ideas into the phone. It's really pretentious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I liked that movie about Harvey Milk, that Sean Penn played Harvey Milk,  because that all took place before I was alive, mostly, in the Bay Area. But there's these beautiful scenes of him, as I recall, sitting there at his kitchen table talking into a tape recorder at night, talking about how he predicted that he would be possibly assassinated, et cetera.  And this goes back to the Strummer thing about writing things down. I think that a lot of people, including myself feel a little bit of egotistical guilt around, who am I to think that my ideas could be worthwhile or something?  But I think over time, I've come to realize that the ideas about experiments or questions I have about health, they don't always, but oftentimes can lead to real seeds that grow into big trees.  RICK RUBIN: But it's something that's interesting to you, it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. Most of my notes are not for anyone else's-- for anyone else's used. Like I hear about something that's interesting to me and I think about, OK, I want to learn more  about this, whatever it is. And then, sometimes those things work their way into things I'm doing because the universe seems to work in that way, but I rarely am learning something with the idea of using it.  I learn things with the idea of, this is what I want to know. This is what's interesting to me. And then often those things that are interesting to me can find their way into other projects just because they do.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, that's almost like coal or kindling, but the moment that you think of it that way, it sounds so extractive. So you take this walk and you're writing down  the occasional idea, perhaps. And then what is the next-- the way that-- here are less than, do this, then this, then that. I'm interested in, where does your mind shift to? Does it become more structured as the day goes on?  Does your thinking become more structured around projects and plans? RICK RUBIN: I try to deal with things that need dealing with after that and in preparation for going to work.  And then when I go to work, it's more like free-- this free thing where I'm, again, hoping something good comes, welcoming something good, paying attention, and maybe  trying to will it to happen, but knowing I don't have the ability to make it happen. I can just be present for it and be ready if it does arrive.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: Some of the more surprising and I found really interesting and useful features of the book were about dancing with structure and lack of structure. So when I think of structure, I think of deadlines.  So when you are in the process of creating something, obviously, deadlines are relevant, time of day. There's only so many hours in the day where one can stay in the groove or the readiness to receive.  Have you ever found yourself in that mode where you're grinding like, oh, here we are. OK, I'm not coming home for dinner. It's the next-- we're going to push, put on the coffee pot kind of thing. RICK RUBIN: A lot. A lot.  Over the course of my life, a lot, not as much now. And one of the things that I discovered through working on the book was the phases of work--  we're not required to treat the different phases of work in the same way, whereas before, I did. Before, everything was in this state of play. Everything had a wide open time schedule.  It happens when it happens. And if it takes two years or three years, it doesn't matter. It's not about that. It's only about this thing has to be great. And what I came to realize in working on the book is that there are different phases.  And the first phase is this seed collecting phase, which is an ongoing part of life in general. I do that. I do that always whether I'm working on something or not. I'm always in the seed collecting phase.  And there's no deadline or just anything that interests me that I think I want to learn more about or has potential to be something, anything. I hear something, I think, uhm, I'd like to read more about that, or I wonder  if there's a movie about that. Is there a movie about that? If not, maybe there's a movie to be made. Again, I want-- this is something I want in my life. Let's see if it exists. If it doesn't exist, then maybe that's something interesting to pursue.  But I know that the desire is there because I have it. So in the seed phase, there's no deadlines. It's just a wide open part. And then the next phase is called the experimentation phase, where we start experimenting to see  what the seeds want to do. You're involved but you're more of a-- you're not really dictating the action.  You're setting the stage for something to happen, but it's not about you yet. So it'd be like the equivalent of you'd plant the seed. You'd would water it. You'd make sure it was in the sun.  And you'd wait. So you're involved, but you can't make it grow. And then when it sprouts, and it grows, or if it turns into a plant, then you can look at the plants like, OK, how does this plant--  what's the potential of this plant? And then that the third phase is the crafting phase, where it's like, OK, I have this plant, maybe I'm going to trim it or maybe I'm going to combine it with these other plants to make something else with it.  Now, it's like material that you have. And then finally is the completion or finishing phase, which is the final edit, getting to the version of it-- the version of it that's the one that you can share with the world if that's  something you're going to do. And I've come to realize that by the time you're going into the completion phase, you can have a deadline. And it won't hurt the project. In fact, it might help the project.  And I didn't know that before. So I've worked on projects that have gone longer than they necessarily needed to and maybe not in the best interests of the project because I didn't know that. I didn't understand the timing of that  because I am so aware of the necessity in the experimental phase to not have a deadline that I assumed that held through the whole project.  And they're not-- it's not a clear phase one finishes, and then you start phase two. Phase two finishes and you start phase three. You move back and forth between them. I'm collecting seeds all the time. I'm always in phase one. And then, probably to some degree,  there's always some version of experimentation going on, maybe not now, but if something's on a list of things I want to look at, hopefully, I'll get to the list and give them some experimentation and see what they can turn into. And then if they do turn into something,  then they get to the crafting phase where it's more, OK, now I have this thing. What do I know about this thing? What can I match this with? What can I use this for? How can I be involved as a craftsman?  And by the end of the crafting phase or deep into the crafting phase, you can start seeing the end. You can start seeing an end. And then you can even dictate an end. But I recommend, if you do, just dictate it  for you not for anyone else because if something comes up where you learn-- if you set a deadline, public deadline, and then a new discovery happens along the way. And you realize, oh, this could actually  be much better than I thought, but I need more time, it's harder to do that if you set the deadline. So I would say, have an internal deadline to get to finish it. That said, if an unusual situation comes up  and it's better for everything not to meet that deadline, it's one of those rules that-- you set the rule to break it if it's what's best for the project. But that was a new thing for me. And it helped me a lot.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: When did you realize that? RICK RUBIN: In collecting the material for the book and thinking about it. When I realized that it was phases-- I didn't know any of this. When I started writing the book, I didn't know hardly any of the things in the book.  Most of it would be reverse engineering something that I had experienced, a successful experience using these methods without knowing they were methods, just  following my instincts got me to something good. And then I would look back at, why did I want to do that? And is there a principle at play that could  be of use outside of this case? And how do I explain that? And that's what the book is, these reverse engineered principles that  have led to a good decision making and try and make things. ANDREW HUBERMAN: The chapter on self-doubt was really interesting to me. RICK RUBIN: Tell me what it says because I can't remember.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'll read the first sentence of it, which is that self-doubt lives in all of us. And while we may wish it was gone, it is there to serve us. And it goes on to describe how to dance with self-doubt  in not so many words. I think there's a saying that is actually from the landscape of psychology, which is generally  discussed in a pathological context, which is, if nothing matters, anything goes. This is usually the phrase used to describe people who feel as if there's no use in living,  so just go crazy, often to self destruct. But there's a light version of this, I realize, where in some sense the creative process seems to have something to do with-- if you're not paying attention to what  outcomes are like who likes it, who doesn't like it, and you're just doing it for you, you make the rule play, I want to delight myself. Well then, anything goes and you have an infinite rule set there to extract from, at least initially.  So as one gets better at their craft, you can imagine self-doubt goes down. I think that's the perception of a lot of people. You get better at what you're doing. You can land free throws as a basketball player.  You can hit more home runs as a baseball player. You can produce more platinum albums as an artist. Self confidence goes up. Self-doubt goes down. But I think you and I both know a number of people who are successful enough  to know that oftentimes there's a mirror image to that, where people feel pressure because they did it once now they got to do it again. RICK RUBIN: Yes or that you think you're so good at it  that it comes easily and you don't have to apply yourself. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance. RICK RUBIN: Yeah. So self-doubt it's like a-- it's a check on yourself.  It can either be really helpful or it can undermine you. So it's something we all have. And if we let it undermine us, then we don't make anything and that's not good.  But when used as a balancing tool in our lives, it serves a great function where we really do-- it's OK to have all the confidence in the world and still second guess,  is this the best it can be? You can doubt-- I think the phrase is in the book. You can doubt your way to a great work, to a masterpiece. Sometimes that questioning allows  you to push further than just accepting, I made it so it's good. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I've encountered more people that seem to be driven by self-doubt and the need to constantly perform and perform again,  then I have real arrogance. Just hasn't been my experience, fortunately. I've met some arrogant people in my life. And of course, we never-- as a psychiatrist who I admire a lot and bio-engineer who was a guest on this podcast Carl Di Saraf said,  we never really know how other people feel. I mean, most of the time, we don't even know how we feel. Again, language is a very deprived format for explaining feelings. So we think somebody feels one way but we can observe-- and it could be another, but we observe their behavior.  So in the sense of returning to the work, just always returning to process, it sounds like your routine is fairly scripted, at least now. But the things that you are getting  in touch with-- wrestling, sleep and dreaming, the ocean, there's a predictability of them because you can access them in a predictable way, but they seem to have a lot of unpredictability in them.  The ocean is completely unpredictable. RICK RUBIN: I also listen to a lot of music that I don't know. So I listen to a lot of classical music, and less so  but some jazz, and a lot of old music that I never heard before. And I like being surprised by music. And sometimes it really catches me off guard.  I shazam a lot when I hear something I like. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Have you ever encountered music that really works well live but just does not work in a recording? Or that it's much better live but the recording is sort of, meh.  You don't have to name names. RICK RUBIN: I don't think so. I feel like maybe there are some artists who are great live who've never captured it well on record. Example would probably be the Grateful Dead is a good example of a band where  I feel like their albums are not their strong point. But if you hear live recordings, they're really interesting and really different from each other. And that's part of what makes the Grateful Dead interesting is their unpredictability. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I confess.  I had a sister who listened to the Grateful Dead. And I got taken to a few shows when I was younger. And they would do that-- was it called space? It was these drum solos that would go on for hours and hours. This is like the antithesis of punk rock shows, where songs are like 90 to 120 seconds.  And I remember thinking, what is this? What is this? But people I know, who love the Grateful Dead, love that uncertainty about where that drum thing-- I think they do call it space. Forgive me deadheads.  I'm not enough of one to get it right. RICK RUBIN: But they're looking for something. And sometimes they find it. And if you're there when they find it, it feels exciting because it's not just-- it's not just following a script.  It's like something is really happening. It's a real moment. Something that I aim for in the studio  is to create real moments that when you hear them, they don't necessarily sound perfect. They sound like something that really happened. And in that moment, something happened. And it's a special moment.  And you can feel that if they were to play it again, it wouldn't be like that. There's something really exciting about that. It's really what-- it's how jazz works as well.  And I think some of-- bringing some of that jazz mentality into other types of music is really interesting, makes for compelling things, because when you hear them,  there's a certain amount of-- you really have to pay attention to do it. When you're doing it, you're really paying attention. It's like, I don't really know. There's no music.  There's no map to follow. And now we're working together to make something. Do I play or not play? When do I play? And you're really paying attention. And can I add or you go to start adding something. And someone else added something.  It's like, oh, I can't do that. And it's like everyone's just in this thing, in this moment experiencing this thing at once that you can feel as a listener.  And we get to hear their excitement of finding it. And it's thrilling when it happens. So I like that experience. I feel that's what the Dead do live.  They'll play songs in different ways. And again, I don't know very much about the Dead. It's newer for me to listen to the Dead. Growing up, I never listen to the Dead, but probably because I heard songs on their albums  and thought, this doesn't really speak to me. But I think that the albums don't really reflect what's special about them. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think a lot of their shows were recorded or videotaped-- RICK RUBIN: By fans which they supported.  They supported that everybody come, everybody tape, everybody trade tapes. It made sense for who that band was. ANDREW HUBERMAN: They redefined or they defined-- excuse me, the notion of followers. I mean, people literally gave up their lives  or spent much of their lives literally driving from city to city to follow them. RICK RUBIN: Because it's not like going from city to city to watch a movie over and over because it's not a movie. It's different every night. It's changing.  ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's pretty incredible phenomenon. I don't know of anything else quite like it except cults. And those often don't end well. I think a guy that mixed the punch for the Jonestown Massacre went to my high school.  RICK RUBIN: Is that true? ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think so. RICK RUBIN: That's amazing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: My sister is really good at all this '70s, '80s dark psychology trivia. She's a very light person. RICK RUBIN: Did you read Season of the Witch. ANDREW HUBERMAN: No. RICK RUBIN: It's about San Francisco in the '60s.  It's great. You'll love it. Great book. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I ought to check it out. The way you describe experiences going by in time, or things emerging in time, and the creative process being  a way of capturing those moments, maybe rearranging, maybe watering, et cetera, I thought was beautifully captured in the analogy you  gave about a conveyor belt going by of things. We think of the creative process like it's going to land in us, or we're going to enter it, or that we're going to sit there in a chair and grit our teeth.  There's some Hemingway quote where you just sit there and stare at the page until the beads of blood form on your forehead or something, maybe it was him, maybe it was-- I don't know. It sounds like Bukowski or something. Anyway, I'm going to get this wrong. People tell me in the comments. Maybe no one said it.  It was a dream. But I love this conveyor belt thing. That reminds me of being in laboratory, doing experiments thinking I was trying to solve one thing, and then seeing something else, and then having to make the decision, like is that really cool enough  to drop everything and go that direction, or to spend a night, or a week, or a career going that way? I mean, these are big decisions, given that at least as far as we know, we're going to live 100 years or less.  But this idea that we have thoughts and experiences in our past. And we can draw on, and try, and make good decisions-- do we grab these things off the conveyor or not? I'm hearing you.  And I'm starting to realize that being attached to the past might be the worst thing that one could do in terms of being able to make good decisions in this context, because we have a playbook of what's worked and what hasn't worked.  But you actually talk about this-- there's a passage in the book that-- I'll just read it. To be aware of the assumption that the way you work is the best way simply because it's the way you've done it before.  I sat with this page for almost 10 full minutes, which is not something I do very often. Maybe you could elaborate on this a little bit. I mean, we want to have mechanisms and routines we  can trust, but this is, I think, an important warning. RICK RUBIN: Yeah when something works, it's easy to be fooled into believing  that's the way to do it or that's the right way. It's just a way. And it's just a way that happened to work that time. And this plays into when you get advice  from people who have more experience than you. You explain your situation. They tell you their advice. The advice that they're giving you is not based on your life or your experience.  It's based on their life and their experience. And the stories that they're telling are based on experiences they've had, that have very different data points than yours.  So maybe they're giving you good advice, but maybe they're giving you good advice for them and not giving you good advice for you. And it's easy when we try something and have  a result, a positive result thinking, everybody can do this. The way I was vegan for a long time, 22 years. And then I started eating--  I started eating animal protein and then eventually changed my diet a few times to the point where I lost a lot of weight. The way that I did it worked for me.  Right before that happened, I did something that I was told that everyone else who did what you did, they all lost weight, for whatever reason, I didn't.  So the idea that we know what's right for someone else-- I think, it's hard enough to even figure out what's right for ourselves. And if we do somehow crack the code of what's right for us,  be happy we have it, and then still know, I wonder if that's the only way. Maybe there's an even better way that we're not considering. Not to get comfortable with thinking we know how it works just because we  get the outcome we want. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was raised in science with a principle. It was literally dictated to me as a principle, almost like a rule of religion, which was that the brain is plastic. It can change and learn until you're about 25. And then the critical periods end and that's it.  And this was a rule. Essentially, it was dictated a Nobel Prize, which was very deserved, given to my scientific great grandparents. They deserve it. But I was told there was no changing of brain structure  function in any meaningful way after age 25 or so. It turns out that's completely wrong. Sorry David and Torsten, but they knew it was wrong. RICK RUBIN: Wow, that's interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, it was actively  suppressed because of the competitive nature of prizes and discoveries at that time. And a guy named Mike Merzenich and his student, Gregg Recanzone were showing that adult plasticity exists  and only now is this really starting to emerge as a theme, just crazy. There were so many reasons and the textbooks said it. We were all told it. And it changed our behavior. Now we know this to be completely false.  There's plasticity throughout the lifespan. There's limits to it here and there, but it's just far and away a different story. RICK RUBIN: So why would that be the only time that ever happened? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly. But the field was run by a very small cabal of people at that time.  RICK RUBIN: All fields are run by a very small cabal of people who have an investment in things being the way they are now because they're in charge. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And one of the great things about getting older is that-- well, fortunately, everyone eventually ages. And I hope that--  David unfortunately passed away. He was lovely. Torsten is lovely. He's still alive. And they would say-- I think Torsten would say, yeah, we should have been a little more open or kind in allowing these other ideas. But I think that-- RICK RUBIN: But just think about all the years ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "What are the goals of the podcast?", "Question 2": "What benefits does light therapy provide?", "Question 3": "Who contributed to the research on negative ionization therapy?", "Question 4": "What are the misconceptions about acupuncture?", "Question 5": "How has science validated acupuncture's effectiveness?", "Question 6": "What role does belief play in creativity?", "Question 7": "Why is being present important for creativity?", "Question 8": "How does meditation affect the creative process?", "Question 9": "What types of meditation does the speaker practice?", "Question 10": "What is the main message of Rick Rubin's book?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "One of the goals of the podcast is to try and shed light on ideas that at first seem crazy.", "Answer 2": "Light therapy, specifically negative ionization therapy, is associated with benefits for sleep and mood, as well as being linked to phototherapy for treating medical conditions like lupus.", "Answer 3": "Michael Term from Colombia contributed to the research on negative ionization therapy.", "Answer 4": "For a lot of years people said acupuncture had no mechanism, meaning there was skepticism about how it could work scientifically.", "Answer 5": "A lab at Harvard has been dedicated to uncovering the biological mechanisms of acupuncture, discovering that it has incredible effects on anti-inflammation, which supports the longstanding belief in its effectiveness.

I'm just incapable of not doing\u00a0 that. There's a bunch of times when we wanted to\u00a0\u00a0 launch features and then Apple's just like\u00a0 nope you're not launching that I was like\u00a0\u00a0  that sucks. Are we set up for that with AI where\u00a0 you're going to get a handful of companies that\u00a0\u00a0 run these closed models that are going to be in\u00a0 control of the apis and therefore are going to be\u00a0\u00a0 able to tell you what you can build? Then when\u00a0 you start getting into building a data center\u00a0\u00a0  that's like 300 Megawatts or 500 Megawatts or a\u00a0 Gigawatt - just no one has built a single Gigawatt\u00a0\u00a0 data center yet. From wherever you sit there's\u00a0 going to be some actor who you don't trust - if\u00a0\u00a0  they're the ones who have the super strong AI I\u00a0 think that that's potentially a much bigger risk Mark, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for having me. Big fan of your podcast.\u00a0 Thank you, that's very nice of you to say.\u00a0 Let's start by talking about the releases\u00a0\u00a0  that will go out when this interview\u00a0 goes out. Tell me about the models and\u00a0\u00a0 Meta AI. What\u2019s new and exciting about them? I think the main thing that most people in the\u00a0\u00a0 world are going to see is the new version of\u00a0 Meta AI. The most important thing that we're\u00a0\u00a0  doing is the upgrade to the model. We're\u00a0 rolling out Llama-3. We're doing it both\u00a0\u00a0 as open source for the dev community and it is\u00a0 now going to be powering Meta AI. There's a lot\u00a0\u00a0 that I'm sure we'll get into around Llama-3,\u00a0 but I think the bottom line on this is that\u00a0\u00a0  we think now that Meta AI is the most intelligent,\u00a0 freely-available AI assistant that people can use.\u00a0\u00a0 We're also integrating Google\u00a0 and Bing for real-time knowledge.\u00a0  We're going to make it a lot more prominent across\u00a0 our apps. At the top of Facebook and Messenger,\u00a0\u00a0 you'll be able to just use the search box right\u00a0 there to ask any question. There's a bunch of new\u00a0\u00a0  creation features that we added that I think are\u00a0 pretty cool and that I think people will enjoy.\u00a0\u00a0 I think animations is a good one. You can\u00a0 basically take any image and just animate it.\u00a0  One that people are going to find pretty wild\u00a0 is that it now generates high quality images\u00a0\u00a0 so quickly that it actually generates it as\u00a0 you're typing and updates it in real time.\u00a0\u00a0  \u2028So you're typing your query and it's honing\u00a0 in. It\u2019s like \u201cshow me a picture of a cow in\u00a0\u00a0  a field with mountains in the background, eating\u00a0 macadamia nuts, drinking beer\u201d and it's updating\u00a0\u00a0 the image in real time. It's pretty wild. I\u00a0 think people are going to enjoy that. So I\u00a0\u00a0  think that's what most people are going to see in\u00a0 the world. We're rolling that out, not everywhere,\u00a0\u00a0 but we're starting in a handful of countries and\u00a0 we'll do more over the coming weeks and months.\u00a0\u00a0 I think that\u2019s going to be a pretty big deal\u00a0 and I'm really excited to get that in people's\u00a0\u00a0  hands. It's a big step forward for Meta AI. But I think if you want to get under the hood\u00a0\u00a0 a bit, the Llama-3 stuff is obviously the most\u00a0 technically interesting. We're training three\u00a0\u00a0  versions: an 8 billion parameter model and a 70\u00a0 billion, which we're releasing today, and a 405\u00a0\u00a0 billion dense model, which is still training. So\u00a0 we're not releasing that today, but I'm pretty\u00a0\u00a0  excited about how the 8B and the 70B turned out.\u00a0 They're leading for their scale. We'll release a\u00a0\u00a0 blog post with all the benchmarks so people can\u00a0 check it out themselves. Obviously it's open\u00a0\u00a0  source so people get a chance to play with it. We have a roadmap of new releases coming that\u00a0\u00a0 are going to bring multimodality, more\u00a0 multi-linguality, and bigger context\u00a0\u00a0  windows as well. Hopefully, sometime later in the\u00a0 year we'll get to roll out the 405B. For where it\u00a0\u00a0  is right now in training, it is already\u00a0 at around 85 MMLU and we expect that it's\u00a0\u00a0 going to have leading benchmarks on a bunch of the\u00a0 benchmarks. I'm pretty excited about all of that.\u00a0\u00a0  The 70 billion is great too. We're releasing that\u00a0 today. It's around 82 MMLU and has leading scores\u00a0\u00a0 on math and reasoning. I think just getting this\u00a0 in people's hands is going to be pretty wild. \u2028\u00a0 Oh, interesting. That's the first I\u2019m hearing\u00a0 of it as a benchmark. That's super impressive.\u00a0  The 8 billion is nearly as powerful as the\u00a0 biggest version of Llama-2 that we released.\u00a0\u00a0 So the smallest Llama-3 is basically\u00a0 as powerful as the biggest Llama-2.\u00a0  Before we dig into these models, I want to go\u00a0 back in time. I'm assuming 2022 is when you\u00a0\u00a0 started acquiring these H100s, or you can tell me\u00a0 when. The stock price is getting hammered. People\u00a0\u00a0 are asking what's happening with all this\u00a0 capex. People aren't buying the metaverse.\u00a0\u00a0  Presumably you're spending that capex to get\u00a0 these H100s. How did you know back then to get the\u00a0\u00a0 H100s? How did you know that you\u2019d need the GPUs? I think it was because we were working on Reels.\u00a0\u00a0  We always want to have enough capacity to build\u00a0 something that we can't quite see on the horizon\u00a0\u00a0  yet. We got into this position with Reels where we\u00a0 needed more GPUs to train the models. It was this\u00a0\u00a0  big evolution for our services. Instead of just\u00a0 ranking content from people or pages you follow,\u00a0\u00a0  we made this big push to start recommending what\u00a0 we call unconnected content, content from people\u00a0\u00a0 or pages that you're not following. \u2028 The corpus of content candidates that\u00a0\u00a0  we could potentially show you expanded from\u00a0 on the order of thousands to on the order of\u00a0\u00a0 hundreds of millions. It needed a completely\u00a0 different infrastructure. We started working\u00a0\u00a0  on doing that and we were constrained on\u00a0 the infrastructure in catching up to what\u00a0\u00a0 TikTok was doing as quickly as we wanted to. I\u00a0 basically looked at that and I was like \u201chey,\u00a0\u00a0  we have to make sure that we're never in this\u00a0 situation again. So let's order enough GPUs to do\u00a0\u00a0 what we need to do on Reels and ranking content\u00a0 and feed. But let's also double that.\u201d Again,\u00a0\u00a0 our normal principle is that there's going to be\u00a0 something on the horizon that we can't see yet.\u00a0  Did you know it would be AI? We thought it was going to be something that\u00a0\u00a0 had to do with training large models. At the time\u00a0 I thought it was probably going to be something\u00a0\u00a0  that had to do with content. It\u2019s just the pattern\u00a0 matching of running the company, there's always\u00a0\u00a0 another thing. At that time I was so deep into\u00a0 trying to get the recommendations working for\u00a0\u00a0  Reels and other content. That\u2019s just such a big\u00a0 unlock for Instagram and Facebook now, being\u00a0\u00a0 able to show people content that's interesting to\u00a0 them from people that they're not even following.\u00a0  But that ended up being a very good decision\u00a0 in retrospect. And it came from being behind.\u00a0\u00a0 It wasn't like \u201coh, I was so far ahead.\u201d\u00a0 Actually, most of the times where we make\u00a0\u00a0  some decision that ends up seeming good\u00a0 is because we messed something up before\u00a0\u00a0 and just didn't want to repeat the mistake. This is a total detour, but I want to ask\u00a0\u00a0 about this while we're on this. We'll get back\u00a0 to AI in a second. In 2006 you didn't sell for\u00a0\u00a0  $1 billion but presumably there's some amount you\u00a0 would have sold for, right? Did you write down\u00a0\u00a0 in your head like \u201cI think the actual valuation\u00a0 of Facebook at the time is this and they're not\u00a0\u00a0 actually getting the valuation right\u201d? If they\u2019d\u00a0 offered you $5 trillion, of course you would have\u00a0\u00a0  sold. So how did you think about that choice? \u2028 I think some of these things are just personal.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't know that at the time I was sophisticated\u00a0 enough to do that analysis. I had all these people\u00a0\u00a0  around me who were making all these arguments for\u00a0 a billion dollars like \u201chere's the revenue that\u00a0\u00a0 we need to make and here's how big we need to be.\u00a0 It's clearly so many years in the future.\u201d It was\u00a0\u00a0  very far ahead of where we were at the time. I\u00a0 didn't really have the financial sophistication\u00a0\u00a0 to really engage with that kind of debate. Deep down I believed in what we were doing.\u00a0\u00a0  \u2028I did some analysis like \u201cwhat would I do if I\u00a0 weren\u2019t doing this? Well, I really like building\u00a0\u00a0 things and I like helping people communicate. I\u00a0 like understanding what's going on with people and\u00a0\u00a0  the dynamics between people. So I think if I sold\u00a0 this company, I'd just go build another company\u00a0\u00a0  like this and I kind of like the one I have.\u00a0 So why?\u201d I think a lot of the biggest bets that\u00a0\u00a0  people make are often just based on conviction and\u00a0 values. It's actually usually very hard to do the\u00a0\u00a0 analyses trying to connect the dots forward. You've had Facebook AI Research for a long\u00a0\u00a0  time. Now it's become seemingly central to\u00a0 your company. At what point did making AGI,\u00a0\u00a0 or however you consider that mission,\u00a0 become a key priority of what Meta is doing?\u00a0  It's been a big deal for a while. We started\u00a0 FAIR about 10 years ago. The idea was that,\u00a0\u00a0 along the way to general intelligence or whatever\u00a0 you wanna call it, there are going to be all these\u00a0\u00a0  different innovations and that's going to\u00a0 just improve everything that we do. So we\u00a0\u00a0 didn't conceive of it as a product. It was\u00a0 more of a research group. Over the last 10\u00a0\u00a0  years it has created a lot of different things\u00a0 that have improved all of our products. It\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 advanced the field and allowed other people in\u00a0 the field to create things that have improved our\u00a0\u00a0  products too. I think that that's been great. There's obviously a big change in the last\u00a0\u00a0 few years with ChatGPT and the diffusion\u00a0 models around image creation coming out.\u00a0\u00a0  This is some pretty wild stuff that is\u00a0 pretty clearly going to affect how people\u00a0\u00a0  interact with every app that's out there. At that\u00a0 point we started a second group, the gen AI group,\u00a0\u00a0  with the goal of bringing that stuff into our\u00a0 products and building leading foundation models\u00a0\u00a0 that would power all these different products. \u2028 When we started doing that the theory initially\u00a0\u00a0  was that a lot of the stuff we're doing is\u00a0 pretty social. It's helping people interact\u00a0\u00a0 with creators, helping people interact with\u00a0 businesses, helping businesses sell things or\u00a0\u00a0  do customer support. There\u2019s also basic assistant\u00a0 functionality, whether it's for our apps or the\u00a0\u00a0  smart glasses or VR. So it wasn't completely\u00a0 clear at first that you were going to need full\u00a0\u00a0 AGI to be able to support those use cases. But in\u00a0 all these subtle ways, through working on them,\u00a0\u00a0  I think it's actually become clear that you do.\u00a0 For example, when we were working on Llama-2,\u00a0\u00a0 we didn't prioritize coding because people\u00a0 aren't going to ask Meta AI a lot of coding\u00a0\u00a0 questions in WhatsApp. Now they will, right?\u00a0  I don't know. I'm not sure that WhatsApp, or\u00a0 Facebook or Instagram, is the UI where people are\u00a0\u00a0 going to be doing a lot of coding questions. Maybe\u00a0 the website, meta.ai, that we\u2019re launching. But\u00a0\u00a0  the thing that has been a somewhat surprising\u00a0 result over the last 18 months is that it turns\u00a0\u00a0 out that coding is important for a lot of domains,\u00a0 not just coding. Even if people aren't asking\u00a0\u00a0  coding questions, training the models on coding\u00a0 helps them become more rigorous in answering the\u00a0\u00a0 question and helps them reason across a lot of\u00a0 different types of domains. That's one example\u00a0\u00a0  where for Llama-3, we really focused on training\u00a0 it with a lot of coding because that's going\u00a0\u00a0 to make it better on all these things even if\u00a0 people aren't asking primarily coding questions.\u00a0  Reasoning is another example. Maybe you want\u00a0 to chat with a creator or you're a business and\u00a0\u00a0 you're trying to interact with a customer.\u00a0 That interaction is not just like \u201cokay,\u00a0\u00a0  the person sends you a message and you\u00a0 just reply.\u201d It's a multi-step interaction\u00a0\u00a0 where you're trying to think through \u201chow do I\u00a0 accomplish the person's goals?\u201d A lot of times\u00a0\u00a0 when a customer comes, they don't necessarily\u00a0 know exactly what they're looking for or how\u00a0\u00a0  to ask their questions. So it's not really the\u00a0 job of the AI to just respond to the question.\u00a0 You need to kind of think about it\u00a0 more holistically. It really becomes\u00a0\u00a0 a reasoning problem. So if someone else solves\u00a0 reasoning, or makes good advances on reasoning,\u00a0\u00a0  and we're sitting here with a basic chat bot,\u00a0 then our product is lame compared to what other\u00a0\u00a0 people are building. At the end of the day, we\u00a0 basically realized we've got to solve general\u00a0\u00a0  intelligence and we just upped the ante and the\u00a0 investment to make sure that we could do that.\u00a0 So the version of\u2028Llama that's going to solve\u00a0 all these use cases for users, is that the\u00a0\u00a0  version that will be powerful enough to replace\u00a0 a programmer you might have in this building?\u00a0 I just think that all this stuff is\u00a0 going to be progressive over time. \u2028\u00a0 But in the end case: Llama-10. I think that there's a lot baked\u00a0\u00a0  into that question. I'm not sure that we're\u00a0 replacing people as much as we\u2019re giving\u00a0\u00a0 people tools to do more stuff. Is the programmer in this building\u00a0\u00a0 10x more productive after Llama-10? \u2028 I would hope more. I don't believe that\u00a0\u00a0  there's a single threshold of intelligence for\u00a0 humanity because people have different skills.\u00a0\u00a0 I think that at some point AI is probably going to\u00a0 surpass people at most of those things, depending\u00a0\u00a0  on how powerful the models are. But I think it's\u00a0 progressive and I don't think AGI is one thing.\u00a0\u00a0 You're basically adding different capabilities.\u00a0 Multimodality is a key one that we're focused on\u00a0\u00a0  now, initially with photos and images and text but\u00a0 eventually with videos. Because we're so focused\u00a0\u00a0 on the metaverse, 3D type stuff is important\u00a0 too. One modality that I'm pretty focused on,\u00a0\u00a0  that I haven't seen as many other people in the\u00a0 industry focus on, is emotional understanding. So\u00a0\u00a0 much of the human brain is just dedicated\u00a0 to understanding people and understanding\u00a0\u00a0  expressions and emotions. I think that's\u00a0 its own whole modality, right? You could\u00a0\u00a0 say that maybe it's just video or image, but it's\u00a0 clearly a very specialized version of those two.\u00a0  So there are all these different capabilities\u00a0 that you want to train the models to focus\u00a0\u00a0 on, in addition to getting a lot better at\u00a0 reasoning and memory, which is its own whole\u00a0\u00a0  thing. I don't think in the future we're going to\u00a0 be primarily shoving things into a query context\u00a0\u00a0 window to ask more complicated questions. There\u00a0 will be different stores of memory or different\u00a0\u00a0  custom models that are more personalized to\u00a0 people. These are all just different capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0 Obviously then there\u2019s making them big and small.\u00a0 We care about both. If you're running something\u00a0\u00a0  like Meta AI, that's pretty server-based. We also\u00a0 want it running on smart glasses and there's not\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of space in smart glasses. So you want to\u00a0 have something that's very efficient for that.\u00a0  If you're doing $10Bs worth of\u00a0 inference or even eventually $100Bs,\u00a0\u00a0 if you're using intelligence in an industrial\u00a0 scale what is the use case? Is it simulations?\u00a0\u00a0 Is it the AIs that will be in the metaverse?\u00a0 What will we be using the data centers for?\u00a0  Our bet is that it's going to basically change\u00a0 all of the products. I think that there's going\u00a0\u00a0 to be a kind of Meta AI general assistant\u00a0 product. I think that that will shift from\u00a0\u00a0  something that feels more like a chatbot, where\u00a0 you ask a question and it formulates an answer,\u00a0\u00a0 to things where you're giving it more complicated\u00a0 tasks and then it goes away and does them. That's\u00a0\u00a0 going to take a lot of inference and it's going\u00a0 to take a lot of compute in other ways too.\u00a0  Then I think interacting with other agents for\u00a0 other people is going to be a big part of what\u00a0\u00a0 we do, whether it's for businesses or creators. A\u00a0 big part of my theory on this is that there's not\u00a0\u00a0  going to be just one singular AI that you interact\u00a0 with. Every business is going to want an AI that\u00a0\u00a0 represents their interests. They're not going to\u00a0 want to primarily interact with you through an AI\u00a0\u00a0  that is going to sell their competitors\u2019 products. I think creators is going to be a big one. There\u00a0\u00a0  are about 200 million creators on our platforms.\u00a0 They basically all have the pattern where they\u00a0\u00a0 want to engage their community but they're limited\u00a0 by the hours in the day. Their community generally\u00a0\u00a0 wants to engage them, but they don't know that\u00a0 they're limited by the hours in the day. If\u00a0\u00a0  you could create something where that creator\u00a0 can basically own the AI, train it in the way\u00a0\u00a0 they want, and engage their community, I think\u00a0 that's going to be super powerful. There's going\u00a0\u00a0  to be a ton of engagement across all these things. These are just the consumer use cases. My wife and\u00a0\u00a0  I run our foundation, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.\u00a0 We're doing a bunch of stuff on science and\u00a0\u00a0 there's obviously a lot of AI work that is going\u00a0 to advance science and healthcare and all these\u00a0\u00a0  things. So it will end up affecting basically\u00a0 every area of the products and the economy.\u00a0 You mentioned AI that can just go out and do\u00a0 something for you that's multi-step. Is that\u00a0\u00a0  a bigger model? With Llama-4 for example, will\u00a0 there still be a version that's 70B but you'll\u00a0\u00a0 just train it on the right data and that will\u00a0 be super powerful? What does the progression\u00a0\u00a0  look like? Is it scaling? Is it just the same size\u00a0 but different banks like you were talking about?\u00a0 I don't know that we know the answer to that. I\u00a0 think one thing that seems to be a pattern is that\u00a0\u00a0  you have the Llama model and then you build some\u00a0 kind of other application specific code around it.\u00a0\u00a0  Some of it is the fine-tuning for the use case,\u00a0 but some of it is, for example, logic for how\u00a0\u00a0 Meta AI should work with tools like Google or Bing\u00a0 to bring in real-time knowledge. That's not part\u00a0\u00a0  of the base Llama model. For Llama-2, we had some\u00a0 of that and it was a little more hand-engineered.\u00a0\u00a0 Part of our goal for Llama-3 was to bring more\u00a0 of that into the model itself. For Llama-3,\u00a0\u00a0  as we start getting into more of these agent-like\u00a0 behaviors, I think some of that is going to be\u00a0\u00a0 more hand-engineered. Our goal for Llama-4\u00a0 will be to bring more of that into the model.\u00a0  At each step along the way you have a sense of\u00a0 what's going to be possible on the horizon. You\u00a0\u00a0 start messing with it and hacking around it. I\u00a0 think that helps you then hone your intuition\u00a0\u00a0 for what you want to try to train into the next\u00a0 version of the model itself. That makes it more\u00a0\u00a0  general because obviously for anything that you're\u00a0 hand-coding you can unlock some use cases, but\u00a0\u00a0  it's just inherently brittle and non-general. \u2028 When you say \u201cinto the model itself,\u201d you train it\u00a0\u00a0  on the thing that you want in the model itself?\u00a0 What do you mean by \u201cinto the model itself\u201d?\u00a0  For Llama- 2, the tool use was very specific,\u00a0 whereas Llama-3 has much better tool use. We\u00a0\u00a0  don't have to hand code all the stuff to have\u00a0 it use Google and go do a search. It can just do\u00a0\u00a0  that. Similarly for coding and running code and\u00a0 a bunch of stuff like that. Once you kind of get\u00a0\u00a0  that capability, then you get a peek at what we\u00a0 can start doing next. We don't necessarily want\u00a0\u00a0 to wait until Llama-4 is around to start building\u00a0 those capabilities, so we can start hacking around\u00a0\u00a0 it. You do a bunch of hand coding and that\u00a0 makes the products better, if only for the\u00a0\u00a0  interim. That helps show the way then of what we\u00a0 want to build into the next version of the model.\u00a0 What is the community fine tune of Llama-3\u00a0 that you're most excited for? Maybe not the\u00a0\u00a0 one that will be most useful to you, but the\u00a0 one you'll just enjoy playing with the most.\u00a0\u00a0  They fine-tune it on antiquity and\u00a0 you'll just be talking to Virgil\u00a0\u00a0 or something. What are you excited about? I think the nature of the stuff is that you\u00a0\u00a0  get surprised. Any specific thing that I thought\u00a0 would be valuable, we'd probably be building. I\u00a0\u00a0  think you'll get distilled versions. I\u00a0 think you'll get smaller versions. One\u00a0\u00a0 thing is that I think 8B isn\u2019t quite small\u00a0 enough for a bunch of use cases. Over time I'd\u00a0\u00a0  love to get a 1-2B parameter model, or even a 500M\u00a0 parameter model and see what you can do with that.\u00a0  If with 8B parameters we\u2019re nearly as\u00a0 powerful as the largest Llama-2 model,\u00a0\u00a0 then with a billion parameters you should be able\u00a0 to do something that's interesting, and faster.\u00a0\u00a0  It\u2019d be good for classification, or a lot of\u00a0 basic things that people do before understanding\u00a0\u00a0 the intent of a user query and feeding it\u00a0 to the most powerful model to hone in on\u00a0\u00a0  what the prompt should be. I think that's one\u00a0 thing that maybe the community can help fill\u00a0\u00a0 in. We're also thinking about getting around to\u00a0 distilling some of these ourselves but right now\u00a0\u00a0  the GPUs are pegged training the 405B. \u2028 So you have all these GPUs. I think you\u00a0\u00a0 said 350,000 by the end of the year. \u2028 That's the whole fleet. We built two,\u00a0\u00a0  I think 22,000 or 24,000 clusters that are the\u00a0 single clusters that we have for training the big\u00a0\u00a0 models, obviously across a lot of the stuff that\u00a0 we do. A lot of our stuff goes towards training\u00a0\u00a0  Reels models and Facebook News Feed and Instagram\u00a0 Feed. Inference is a huge thing for us because we\u00a0\u00a0 serve a ton of people. Our ratio of inference\u00a0 compute required to training is probably much\u00a0\u00a0  higher than most other companies that are doing\u00a0 this stuff just because of the sheer volume of\u00a0\u00a0 the community that we're serving. In the material they shared with\u00a0\u00a0 me before, it was really interesting that you\u00a0 trained it on more data than is compute optimal\u00a0\u00a0  just for training. The inference is such a big\u00a0 deal for you guys, and also for the community,\u00a0\u00a0 that it makes sense to just have this thing\u00a0 and have trillions of tokens in there.\u00a0 Although one of the interesting\u00a0 things about it, even with the 70B,\u00a0\u00a0  is that we thought it would get more saturated. We\u00a0 trained it on around 15 trillion tokens. I guess\u00a0\u00a0 our prediction going in was that it was going\u00a0 to asymptote more, but even by the end it was\u00a0\u00a0  still learning.\u2028We probably could have fed it more\u00a0 tokens and it would have gotten somewhat better.\u00a0 At some point you're running a company and you\u00a0 need to do these meta reasoning questions. Do I\u00a0\u00a0  want to spend our GPUs on training the 70B model\u00a0 further? Do we want to get on with it so we can\u00a0\u00a0 start testing hypotheses for Llama-4? We needed\u00a0 to make that call and I think we got a reasonable\u00a0\u00a0  balance for this version of the 70B. There'll\u00a0 be others in the future, the 70B multimodal one,\u00a0\u00a0 that'll come over the next period. But that\u00a0 was fascinating that the architectures at\u00a0\u00a0  this point can just take so much data. That's really interesting. What does this\u00a0\u00a0 imply about future models? You mentioned that\u00a0 the Llama-3 8B is better than the Llama-2 70B.\u00a0 No, no, it's nearly as good.\u00a0 I don\u2019t want to overstate\u00a0\u00a0  it. It\u2019s in a similar order of magnitude. Does that mean the Llama-4 70B will be\u00a0\u00a0 as good as the Llama-3 405B? What\u00a0 does the future of this look like?\u00a0 This is one of the great questions, right? I think\u00a0 no one knows. One of the trickiest things in the\u00a0\u00a0  world to plan around is an exponential\u00a0 curve. How long does it keep going for?\u00a0\u00a0 I think it's likely enough that we'll keep going.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s worth investing the $10Bs or $100B+\u00a0\u00a0  in building the infrastructure and assuming that\u00a0 if it keeps going you're going to get some really\u00a0\u00a0 amazing things that are going to make amazing\u00a0 products. I don't think anyone in the industry\u00a0\u00a0  can really tell you that it will continue scaling\u00a0 at that rate for sure. In general in history,\u00a0\u00a0 you hit bottlenecks at certain points.\u00a0 Now there's so much energy on this that\u00a0\u00a0  maybe those bottlenecks get knocked over pretty\u00a0 quickly. I think that\u2019s an interesting question.\u2028\u00a0 What does the world look like where there aren't\u00a0 these bottlenecks? Suppose progress just continues\u00a0\u00a0  at this pace, which seems plausible.\u00a0 Zooming out and forgetting about Llamas\u2026\u00a0 Well, there are going to be different bottlenecks.\u00a0 Over the last few years, I think there was this\u00a0\u00a0  issue of GPU production. Even companies that had\u00a0 the money to pay for the GPUs couldn't necessarily\u00a0\u00a0  get as many as they wanted because there were all\u00a0 these supply constraints. Now I think that's sort\u00a0\u00a0 of getting less. So you're seeing a bunch of\u00a0 companies thinking now about investing a lot\u00a0\u00a0  of money in building out these things. I think\u00a0 that that will go on for some period of time.\u00a0\u00a0 There is a capital question. At what point does\u00a0 it stop being worth it to put the capital in?\u00a0  I actually think before we hit that, you're\u00a0 going to run into energy constraints. I don't\u00a0\u00a0 think anyone's built a gigawatt single training\u00a0 cluster yet. You run into these things that just\u00a0\u00a0  end up being slower in the world. Getting energy\u00a0 permitted is a very heavily regulated government\u00a0\u00a0 function. You're going from software, which\u00a0 is somewhat regulated and I'd argue it\u2019s more\u00a0\u00a0  regulated than a lot of people in the tech\u00a0 community feel. Obviously it\u2019s different if\u00a0\u00a0 you're starting a small company, maybe you\u00a0 feel that less. We interact with different\u00a0\u00a0  governments and regulators and we have lots\u00a0 of rules that we need to follow and make sure\u00a0\u00a0 we do a good job with around the world. But\u00a0 I think that there's no doubt about energy.\u00a0  If you're talking about building large new\u00a0 power plants or large build-outs and then\u00a0\u00a0 building transmission lines that cross other\u00a0 private or public land, that\u2019s just a heavily\u00a0\u00a0  regulated thing. You're talking about many\u00a0 years of lead time. If we wanted to stand up\u00a0\u00a0  some massive facility, powering that is a very\u00a0 long-term project. I think people do it but I\u00a0\u00a0  don't think this is something that can be quite\u00a0 as magical as just getting to a level of AI,\u00a0\u00a0 getting a bunch of capital and putting it in, and\u00a0 then all of a sudden the models are just going to\u2026\u00a0\u00a0 You do hit different bottlenecks along the way. Is there something, maybe an AI-related project or\u00a0\u00a0  maybe not, that even a company like Meta doesn't\u00a0 have the resources for? Something where if your\u00a0\u00a0 R&D budget or capex budget were 10x what it is\u00a0 now, then you could pursue it? Something that\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 in the back of your mind but with Meta today,\u00a0 you can't even issue stock or bonds for it?\u00a0\u00a0  It's just like 10x bigger than your budget? I think energy is one piece. I think we\u00a0\u00a0 would probably build out bigger clusters than we\u00a0 currently can if we could get the energy to do it.\u00a0  That's fundamentally money-bottlenecked\u00a0 in the limit? If you had $1 trillion\u2026\u00a0  I think it\u2019s time. It depends on how far the\u00a0 exponential curves go.

However, it also raises questions about how AI will interface with businesses and individuals, with each entity likely wanting an AI tailored to its specific interests. Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of multimodality, reasoning, and memory capabilities in developing future AI models, suggesting that while AI may not completely replace human roles, it could vastly improve efficiencies and capabilities in various tasks.", "Answer 10": "Energy constraints could significantly slow down AI development by limiting the ability to build and operate large training clusters necessary for training powerful AI models. As the demand for more computational resources increases, the need for energy to power these infrastructures becomes a critical factor. If companies can't easily obtain the necessary energy or if energy projects face regulatory hurdles, it could result in lengthy delays in AI advancements, even if there is sufficient capital investment available. Essentially, even with unlimited financial resources, the operational capacity for AI development could be bottlenecked by energy availability.", "Answer 11": "The discussion centers on advancements in AI models, specifically Meta's upcoming Llama 3, which promises significant improvements in capabilities such as real-time image generation and tool usage.

Take a whole\u00a0\u00a0 data center and fill it up with all the stuff\u00a0 that you need to do for training and you build\u00a0\u00a0  the biggest cluster you can. I think a bunch\u00a0 of companies are running at stuff like that.\u00a0  But when you start getting into building a\u00a0 data center that's like 300MW or 500MW or 1 GW,\u00a0\u00a0 no one has built a 1GW data center yet. I think\u00a0 it will happen. This is only a matter of time but\u00a0\u00a0  it's not going to be next year. Some of these\u00a0 things will take some number of years to build\u00a0\u00a0  out. Just to put this in perspective, I think a\u00a0 gigawatt would be the size of a meaningful nuclear\u00a0\u00a0  power plant only going towards training a model. \u2028 Didn't Amazon do this? They have a 950MW\u2013\u00a0 I'm not exactly sure what they\u00a0 did. You'd have to ask them. \u2028\u00a0 But it doesn\u2019t have to be in the\u00a0 same place, right? If distributed\u00a0\u00a0  training works, it can be distributed. Well, I think that is a big question, how\u00a0\u00a0 that's going to work. It seems quite possible that\u00a0 in the future, more of what we call training for\u00a0\u00a0  these big models is actually more along the lines\u00a0 of inference generating synthetic data to then go\u00a0\u00a0 feed into the model. I don't know what that ratio\u00a0 is going to be but I consider the generation of\u00a0\u00a0  synthetic data to be more inference than training\u00a0 today. Obviously if you're doing it in order\u00a0\u00a0 to train a model, it's part of the broader\u00a0 training process. So that's an open question,\u00a0\u00a0  the balance of that and how that plays out. Would that potentially also be the case with\u00a0\u00a0 Llama-3, and maybe Llama-4 onwards? As in, you\u00a0 put this out and if somebody has a ton of compute,\u00a0\u00a0 then they can just keep making these things\u00a0 arbitrarily smarter using the models that\u00a0\u00a0  you've put out. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s some\u00a0 random country, like Kuwait or the UAE,\u00a0\u00a0 that has a ton of compute and they can actually\u00a0 just use Llama-4 to make something much smarter.\u00a0  I do think there are going to be\u00a0 dynamics like that, but I also think\u00a0\u00a0  there is a fundamental limitation on the model\u00a0 architecture. I think like a 70B model that we\u00a0\u00a0  trained with a Llama-3 architecture can get\u00a0 better, it can keep going. As I was saying,\u00a0\u00a0 we felt that if we kept on feeding it more data\u00a0 or rotated the high value tokens through again,\u00a0\u00a0  then it would continue getting better. We've\u00a0 seen a bunch of different companies around\u00a0\u00a0  the world basically take the Llama-2 70B model\u00a0 architecture and then build a new model. But it's\u00a0\u00a0 still the case that when you make a generational\u00a0 improvement to something like the Llama-3 70B or\u00a0\u00a0  the Llama-3 405B, there isn\u2019t anything like\u00a0 that open source today. I think that's a big\u00a0\u00a0 step function. What people are going to be able to\u00a0 build on top of that I think can\u2019t go infinitely\u00a0\u00a0  from there. There can be some optimization in\u00a0 that until you get to the next step function.\u00a0 Let's zoom out a little bit from specific\u00a0 models and even the multi-year lead times\u00a0\u00a0 you would need to get energy approvals and so\u00a0 on. Big picture, what's happening with AI these\u00a0\u00a0  next couple of decades? Does it feel like\u00a0 another technology like the metaverse or\u00a0\u00a0 social, or does it feel like a fundamentally\u00a0 different thing in the course of human history?\u00a0  I think it's going to be pretty fundamental. I\u00a0 think it's going to be more like the creation\u00a0\u00a0 of computing in the first place. You'll get all\u00a0 these new apps in the same way as when you got\u00a0\u00a0  the web or you got mobile phones. People basically\u00a0 rethought all these experiences as a lot of things\u00a0\u00a0 that weren't possible before became possible.\u00a0 So I think that will happen, but I think it's\u00a0\u00a0  a much lower-level innovation. My sense is\u00a0 that it's going to be more like people going\u00a0\u00a0  from not having computers to having computers. It\u2019s very hard to reason about exactly how this\u00a0\u00a0  goes. In the cosmic scale obviously it'll happen\u00a0 quickly, over a couple of decades or something.\u00a0\u00a0  There is some set of people who are afraid of it\u00a0 really spinning out and going from being somewhat\u00a0\u00a0 intelligent to extremely intelligent overnight.\u00a0 I just think that there's all these physical\u00a0\u00a0  constraints that make that unlikely to happen. I\u00a0 just don't really see that playing out. I think\u00a0\u00a0 we'll have time to acclimate a bit. But it will\u00a0 really change the way that we work and give people\u00a0\u00a0  all these creative tools to do different things.\u00a0 I think it's going to really enable people to do\u00a0\u00a0 the things that they want a lot more. So maybe not overnight, but is it your\u00a0\u00a0  view that on a cosmic scale we can think of\u00a0 these milestones in this way? Humans evolved,\u00a0\u00a0 and then AI happened, and then they went out\u00a0 into the galaxy. Maybe it takes many decades,\u00a0\u00a0  maybe it takes a century, but is that the grand\u00a0 scheme of what's happening right now in history? \u2028\u00a0 Sorry, in what sense? In the sense that there were\u00a0\u00a0 other technologies, like computers and even\u00a0 fire, but the development of AI itself is as\u00a0\u00a0  significant as humans evolving in the first place. I think that's tricky.\u2028The history of humanity\u00a0\u00a0  has been people basically thinking that certain\u00a0 aspects of humanity are really unique in different\u00a0\u00a0  ways and then coming to grips with the fact that\u00a0 that's not true, but that humanity is actually\u00a0\u00a0 still super special. We thought that the earth\u00a0 was the center of the universe and it's not,\u00a0\u00a0  but humans are still pretty\u00a0 awesome and pretty unique, right?\u00a0 I think another bias that people tend\u00a0 to have is thinking that intelligence\u00a0\u00a0  is somehow fundamentally connected to life.\u00a0 It's not actually clear that it is. I don't\u00a0\u00a0  know that we have a clear enough definition of\u00a0 consciousness or life to fully interrogate this.\u00a0\u00a0 There's all this science fiction about creating\u00a0 intelligence where it starts to take on all these\u00a0\u00a0  human-like behaviors and things like that. The\u00a0 current incarnation of all this stuff feels like\u00a0\u00a0 it's going in a direction where intelligence\u00a0 can be pretty separated from consciousness,\u00a0\u00a0  agency, and things like that, which I\u00a0 think just makes it a super valuable tool.\u00a0 Obviously it's very difficult to predict\u00a0 what direction this stuff goes in over time,\u00a0\u00a0  which is why I don't think anyone should be\u00a0 dogmatic about how they plan to develop it\u00a0\u00a0 or what they plan to do. You want to look\u00a0 at it with each release. We're obviously\u00a0\u00a0 very pro open source, but I haven't committed\u00a0 to releasing every single thing that we do.\u00a0\u00a0  I\u2019m basically very inclined to think that\u00a0 open sourcing is going to be good for the\u00a0\u00a0 community and also good for us because we'll\u00a0 benefit from the innovations. If at some point\u00a0\u00a0  however there's some qualitative change in what\u00a0 the thing is capable of, and we feel like it's\u00a0\u00a0 not responsible to open source it, then we\u00a0 won't. It's all very difficult to predict.\u00a0  What is a kind of specific qualitative change\u00a0 where you'd be training Llama-5 or Llama-4,\u00a0\u00a0 and if you see it, it\u2019d make you think \u201cyou know\u00a0 what, I'm not sure about open sourcing it\u201d?\u2028\u00a0  It's a little hard to answer that in\u00a0 the abstract because there are negative\u00a0\u00a0 behaviors that any product can exhibit\u00a0 where as long as you can mitigate it,\u00a0\u00a0  it's okay. There\u2019s bad things about social media\u00a0 that we work to mitigate. There's bad things about\u00a0\u00a0 Llama-2 where we spend a lot of time trying\u00a0 to make sure that it's not like helping people\u00a0\u00a0  commit violent acts or things like that. That\u00a0 doesn't mean that it's a kind of autonomous or\u00a0\u00a0 intelligent agent. It just means that it's learned\u00a0 a lot about the world and it can answer a set of\u00a0\u00a0  questions that we think would be unhelpful for it\u00a0 to answer. I think the question isn't really what\u00a0\u00a0  behaviors would it show, it's what things would\u00a0 we not be able to mitigate after it shows that.\u00a0 I think that there's so many ways in which\u00a0 something can be good or bad that it's hard\u00a0\u00a0  to actually enumerate them all up front. Look at\u00a0 what we've had to deal with in social media and\u00a0\u00a0 the different types of harms. We've basically\u00a0 gotten to like 18 or 19 categories of harmful\u00a0\u00a0  things that people do and we've basically built\u00a0 AI systems to identify what those things are and\u00a0\u00a0 to make sure that doesn't happen on our network\u00a0 as much as possible. Over time I think you'll\u00a0\u00a0  be able to break this down into more of a\u00a0 taxonomy too. I think this is a thing that\u00a0\u00a0 we spend time researching as well, because we\u00a0 want to make sure that we understand that. \u2028\u00a0  It seems to me that it would be a good idea.\u00a0 I would be disappointed in a future where AI\u00a0\u00a0 systems aren't broadly deployed and everybody\u00a0 doesn't have access to them. At the same time,\u00a0\u00a0 I want to better understand the mitigations.\u00a0 If the mitigation is the fine-tuning,\u00a0\u00a0  the whole thing about open weights is that you\u00a0 can then remove the fine-tuning, which is often\u00a0\u00a0 superficial on top of these capabilities. If it's\u00a0 like talking on Slack with a biology researcher\u2026\u00a0\u00a0  I think models are very far from this. Right\u00a0 now, they\u2019re like Google search. But if I can\u00a0\u00a0 show them my Petri dish and they can explain why\u00a0 my smallpox sample didn\u2019t grow and what to change,\u00a0\u00a0 how do you mitigate that? Because somebody\u00a0 can just fine-tune that in there, right?\u00a0  That's true. I think a lot of people will\u00a0 basically use the off-the-shelf model and some\u00a0\u00a0 people who have basically bad faith are going to\u00a0 try to strip out all the bad stuff. So I do think\u00a0\u00a0  that's an issue. On the flip side, one of the\u00a0 reasons why I'm philosophically so pro open source\u00a0\u00a0  is that I do think that a concentration of AI in\u00a0 the future has the potential to be as dangerous as\u00a0\u00a0  it being widespread. I think a lot of people think\u00a0 about the questions of \u201cif we can do this stuff,\u00a0\u00a0 is it bad for it to be out in the wild and just\u00a0 widely available?\u201d I think another version of\u00a0\u00a0  this is that it's probably also pretty bad\u00a0 for one institution to have an AI that is\u00a0\u00a0 way more powerful than everyone else's AI. There\u2019s one security analogy that I think\u00a0\u00a0  of. There are so many security holes in so many\u00a0 different things. If you could travel back in\u00a0\u00a0  time a year or two years, let's say you just have\u00a0 one or two years more knowledge of the security\u00a0\u00a0 holes. You can pretty much hack into any system.\u00a0 That\u2019s not AI. So it's not that far-fetched to\u00a0\u00a0  believe that a very intelligent AI probably would\u00a0 be able to identify some holes and basically\u00a0\u00a0 be like a human who could go back in time a\u00a0 year or two and compromise all these systems.\u00a0  So how have we dealt with that as a society?\u00a0 One big part is open source software that\u00a0\u00a0 makes it so that when improvements are made to\u00a0 the software, it doesn't just get stuck in one\u00a0\u00a0  company's products but can be broadly deployed to\u00a0 a lot of different systems, whether they\u2019re banks\u00a0\u00a0 or hospitals or government stuff. As the software\u00a0 gets hardened, which happens because more people\u00a0\u00a0  can see it and more people can bang on it, there\u00a0 are standards on how this stuff works. The world\u00a0\u00a0 can get upgraded together pretty quickly. I think that a world where AI is very widely\u00a0\u00a0  deployed, in a way where it's gotten hardened\u00a0 progressively over time, is one where all the\u00a0\u00a0 different systems will be in check in a way. That\u00a0 seems fundamentally more healthy to me than one\u00a0\u00a0  where this is more concentrated. So there are\u00a0 risks on all sides, but I think that's a risk\u00a0\u00a0 that I don't hear people talking about quite as\u00a0 much. There's the risk of the AI system doing\u00a0\u00a0  something bad. But I stay up at night worrying\u00a0 more about an untrustworthy actor having the super\u00a0\u00a0  strong AI, whether it's an adversarial government\u00a0 or an untrustworthy company or whatever. I think\u00a0\u00a0  that that's potentially a much bigger risk. \u2028 As in, they could overthrow our government because\u00a0\u00a0  they have a weapon that nobody else has? Or just cause a lot of mayhem. I think the\u00a0\u00a0 intuition is that this stuff ends up being\u00a0 pretty important and valuable for both\u00a0\u00a0  economic and security reasons and other things.\u00a0 If someone whom you don't trust or an adversary\u00a0\u00a0 gets something more powerful, then I think that\u00a0 that could be an issue. Probably the best way\u00a0\u00a0  to mitigate that is to have good open source\u00a0 AI that becomes the standard and in a lot of\u00a0\u00a0  ways can become the leader. It just ensures that\u00a0 it's a much more even and balanced playing field.\u00a0 That seems plausible to me. If that works out,\u00a0 that would be the future I prefer. I want to\u00a0\u00a0  understand mechanistically how the fact that\u00a0 there are open source AI systems in the world\u00a0\u00a0 prevents somebody causing mayhem with their AI\u00a0 system? With the specific example of somebody\u00a0\u00a0  coming with a bioweapon, is it just that we'll do\u00a0 a bunch of R&D in the rest of the world to figure\u00a0\u00a0 out vaccines really fast? What's happening? If you take the security one that I was\u00a0\u00a0 talking about, I think someone with\u00a0 a weaker AI trying to hack into a\u00a0\u00a0  system that is protected by a stronger AI will\u00a0 succeed less. In terms of software security\u2013\u00a0 How do we know everything in the world is like\u00a0 that? What if bioweapons aren't like that? \u2028\u00a0  I mean, I don't know that everything in the\u00a0 world is like that. Bioweapons are one of the\u00a0\u00a0  areas where the people who are most worried about\u00a0 this stuff are focused and I think it makes a lot\u00a0\u00a0  of sense. There are certain mitigations. You\u00a0 can try to not train certain knowledge into\u00a0\u00a0  the model. There are different things but at\u00a0 some level if you get a sufficiently bad actor,\u00a0\u00a0  and you don't have other AI that can balance\u00a0 them and understand what the threats are,\u00a0\u00a0 then that could be a risk. That's one of\u00a0 the things that we need to watch out for.\u00a0  Is there something you could see in the deployment\u00a0 of these systems where you're training Llama-4 and\u00a0\u00a0 it lied to you because it thought you weren't\u00a0 noticing or something and you're like \u201cwhoa\u00a0\u00a0  what's going on here?\u201d This is probably not\u00a0 likely with a Llama-4 type system, but is\u00a0\u00a0 there something you can imagine like that where\u00a0 you'd be really concerned about deceptiveness and\u00a0\u00a0  billions of copies of this being out in the wild? I mean right now we see a lot of hallucinations.\u00a0\u00a0  It's more so that. I think it's an interesting\u00a0 question, how you would tell the difference\u00a0\u00a0  between hallucination and deception. There are\u00a0 a lot of risks and things to think about. I try,\u00a0\u00a0  in running our company at least, to balance\u00a0 these longer-term theoretical risks with\u00a0\u00a0  what I actually think are quite real risks that\u00a0 exist today. So when you talk about deception,\u00a0\u00a0 the form of that that I worry about most is\u00a0 people using this to generate misinformation\u00a0\u00a0  and then pump that through our networks or\u00a0 others. The way that we've combated this type\u00a0\u00a0 of harmful content is by building AI systems\u00a0 that are smarter than the adversarial ones.\u00a0  This informs part of my theory on this. If you\u00a0 look at the different types of harm that people\u00a0\u00a0 do or try to do through social networks, there are\u00a0 ones that are not very adversarial. For example,\u00a0\u00a0  hate speech is not super adversarial in the sense\u00a0 that people aren't getting better at being racist.\u00a0\u00a0  That's one where I think the AIs are generally\u00a0 getting way more sophisticated faster than people\u00a0\u00a0 are at those issues. And we have issues both\u00a0 ways. People do bad things, whether they're\u00a0\u00a0  trying to incite violence or something, but\u00a0 we also have a lot of false positives where we\u00a0\u00a0 basically censor stuff that we shouldn't. I think\u00a0 that understandably makes a lot of people annoyed.\u00a0\u00a0 So I think having an AI that gets increasingly\u00a0 precise on that is going to be good over time.\u00a0  But let me give you another example: nation\u00a0 states trying to interfere in elections. That's\u00a0\u00a0 an example where they absolutely have cutting edge\u00a0 technology and absolutely get better each year. So\u00a0\u00a0  we block some technique, they learn what we did\u00a0 and come at us with a different technique. It's\u00a0\u00a0 not like a person trying to say mean things, They\u00a0 have a goal. They're sophisticated. They have a\u00a0\u00a0  lot of technology. In those cases, I still think\u00a0 about the ability to have our AI systems grow in\u00a0\u00a0 sophistication at a faster rate than theirs do.\u00a0 It's an arms race but I think we're at least\u00a0\u00a0  winning that arms race currently. This is a lot\u00a0 of the stuff that I spend time thinking about.\u00a0  Yes, whether it's Llama-4 or Llama-6, we need to\u00a0 think about what behaviors we're observing and\u00a0\u00a0 it's not just us. Part of the reason why you make\u00a0 this open source is that there are a lot of other\u00a0\u00a0  people who study this too. So we want to see what\u00a0 other people are observing, what we\u2019re observing,\u00a0\u00a0 what we can mitigate, and then we'll make\u00a0 our assessment on whether we can make it\u00a0\u00a0  open source. For the foreseeable future I'm\u00a0 optimistic we will be able to. In the near term,\u00a0\u00a0 I don't want to take our eye off the ball\u00a0 in terms of what are actual bad things that\u00a0\u00a0 people are trying to use the models for today.\u00a0 Even if they're not existential, there are\u00a0\u00a0  pretty bad day-to-day harms that we're familiar\u00a0 with in running our services. That's actually a\u00a0\u00a0 lot of what we have to spend our time on as well. I found the synthetic data thing really curious.\u00a0\u00a0  With current models it makes sense why there might\u00a0 be an asymptote with just doing the synthetic data\u00a0\u00a0 again and again. But let\u2019s say they get smarter\u00a0 and you use the kinds of techniques\u2014you talk about\u00a0\u00a0 in the paper or the blog posts that are coming out\u00a0 on the day this will be released\u2014where it goes to\u00a0\u00a0  the thought chain that is the most correct.\u00a0 Why do you think this wouldn't lead to a loop\u00a0\u00a0 where it gets smarter, makes better output, gets\u00a0 smarter and so forth. Of course it wouldn't be\u00a0\u00a0 overnight, but over many months or years of\u00a0 training potentially with a smarter model.\u00a0  I think it could, within the parameters of\u00a0 whatever the model architecture is. It's just\u00a0\u00a0  that with today's 8B parameter models, I don't\u00a0 think you're going to get to be as good as the\u00a0\u00a0  state-of-the-art multi-hundred billion\u00a0 parameter models that are incorporating\u00a0\u00a0 new research into the architecture itself. But those will be open source as well, right?\u00a0  Well yeah, subject to all the questions that we\u00a0 just talked about but yes. We would hope that\u00a0\u00a0 that'll be the case. But I think that at each\u00a0 point, when you're building software there's a\u00a0\u00a0  ton of stuff that you can do with software but\u00a0 then at some level you're constrained by the\u00a0\u00a0 chips that it's running on. So there are always\u00a0 going to be different physical constraints. How\u00a0\u00a0  big the models are is going to be constrained\u00a0 by how much energy you can get and use for\u00a0\u00a0  inference. I'm simultaneously very optimistic\u00a0 that this stuff will continue to improve quickly\u00a0\u00a0  and also a little more measured than I think\u00a0 some people are about it. I don\u2019t think the\u00a0\u00a0  runaway case is a particularly likely one. I think it makes sense to keep your options\u00a0\u00a0 open. There's so much we don't know. There's a\u00a0 case in which it's really important to keep the\u00a0\u00a0 balance of power so nobody becomes a totalitarian\u00a0 dictator. There's a case in which you don't want\u00a0\u00a0  to open source the architecture because China can\u00a0 use it to catch up to America's AIs and there is\u00a0\u00a0 an intelligence explosion and they win that. A lot\u00a0 of things seem possible. Keeping your options open\u00a0\u00a0 considering all of them seems reasonable. Yeah.\u00a0  Let's talk about some other things. Metaverse.\u00a0 What time period in human history would you be\u00a0\u00a0 most interested in going into? 100,000 BCE to\u00a0 now, you just want to see what it was like?\u00a0 It has to be the past? Oh yeah, it has to be the past.\u2028\u00a0  I'm really interested in American history and\u00a0 classical history. I'm really interested in the\u00a0\u00a0 history of science too. I actually think seeing\u00a0 and trying to understand more about how some of\u00a0\u00a0  the big advances came about would be interesting.\u00a0 All we have are somewhat limited writings about\u00a0\u00a0 some of that stuff. I'm not sure the metaverse\u00a0 is going to let you do that because it's going\u00a0\u00a0  to be hard to go back in time for things that\u00a0 we don't have records of. I'm actually not sure\u00a0\u00a0 that going back in time is going to be that\u00a0 important of a thing. I think it's going to\u00a0\u00a0  be cool for like history classes and stuff,\u00a0 but that's probably not the use case that I'm\u00a0\u00a0 most excited about for the metaverse overall. The main thing is just the ability to feel\u00a0\u00a0  present with people, no matter where you are.\u00a0 I think that's going to be killer. In the AI\u00a0\u00a0 conversation that we were having, so much of it\u00a0 is about physical constraints that underlie all\u00a0\u00a0  of this. I think one lesson of technology is\u00a0 that you want to move things from the physical\u00a0\u00a0 constraint realm into software as much as possible\u00a0 because software is so much easier to build and\u00a0\u00a0  evolve. You can democratize it more because\u00a0 not everyone is going to have a data center but\u00a0\u00a0 a lot of people can write code and take open\u00a0 source code and modify it. \u03a4he metaverse\u00a0\u00a0  version of this is enabling realistic digital\u00a0 presence. That\u2019s going to be an absolutely huge\u00a0\u00a0  difference so people don't feel like they have\u00a0 to be physically together for as many things.\u00a0\u00a0 Now I think that there can be things that are\u00a0 better about being physically together. These\u00a0\u00a0  things aren't binary. It's not going to be like\u00a0 \u201cokay, now you don't need to do that anymore.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 But overall, I think it's just going to be\u00a0 really powerful for socializing, for feeling\u00a0\u00a0  connected with people, for working, for parts\u00a0 of industry, for medicine, for so many things. \u2028\u00a0 I want to go back to something you said at the\u00a0 beginning of the conversation. You didn't sell\u00a0\u00a0 the company for a billion dollars. And with\u00a0 the metaverse, you knew you were going to\u00a0\u00a0  do this even though the market was hammering\u00a0 you for it. I'm curious. What is the source\u00a0\u00a0 of that edge? You said \u201coh, values, I have\u00a0 this intuition,\u201d but everybody says that. If\u00a0\u00a0 you had to say something that's specific to\u00a0 you, how would you express what that is? Why\u00a0\u00a0  were you so convinced about the metaverse?\u2028 I think that those are different questions.\u00a0\u00a0  What are the things that power me? We've\u00a0 talked about a bunch of the themes. I just\u00a0\u00a0  really like building things. I specifically like\u00a0 building things around how people communicate and\u00a0\u00a0 understanding how people express themselves\u00a0 and how people work. When I was in college\u00a0\u00a0 I studied computer science and psychology. I\u00a0 think a lot of other people in the industry\u00a0\u00a0  studied computer science. So, it's always been\u00a0 the intersection of those two things for me.\u00a0  It\u2019s also sort of this really deep drive. I\u00a0 don't know how to explain it but I just feel\u00a0\u00a0  constitutionally that I'm doing something wrong if\u00a0 I'm not building something new. Even when we were\u00a0\u00a0  putting together the business case for investing\u00a0 a $100 billion in AI or some huge amount in the\u00a0\u00a0 metaverse, we have plans that I think made\u00a0 it pretty clear that if our stuff works,\u00a0\u00a0  it'll be a good investment. But you can't know\u00a0 for certain from the outset. There are all these\u00a0\u00a0 arguments that people have, with advisors\u00a0 or different folks. It's like, \u201chow are you\u00a0\u00a0  confident enough to do this?\u201d Well the day I stop\u00a0 trying to build new things, I'm just done. I'm\u00a0\u00a0  going to go build new things somewhere else. I'm\u00a0 fundamentally incapable of running something,\u00a0\u00a0  or in my own life, and not trying to build new\u00a0 things that I think are interesting. That's not\u00a0\u00a0 even a question for me, whether we're going to\u00a0 take a swing at building the next thing. I'm\u00a0\u00a0  just incapable of not doing that. I don't know. I'm kind of like this in all the different aspects\u00a0\u00a0  of my life. Our family built this ranch in Kauai\u00a0 and I worked on designing all these buildings. We\u00a0\u00a0  started raising cattle and I'm like \u201calright, I\u00a0 want to make the best cattle in the world so how\u00a0\u00a0 do we architect this so that way we can figure\u00a0 this out and build all the stuff up that we\u00a0\u00a0  need to try to do that.\u201d I don't know, that's\u00a0 me. What was the other part of the question?\u00a0  I'm not sure but I'm actually curious\u00a0 about something else. So a 19-year-old\u00a0\u00a0 Mark reads a bunch of antiquity and\u00a0 classics in high school and college.\u00a0\u00a0 What important lesson did you learn from\u00a0 it? Not just interesting things you found,\u00a0\u00a0  but there aren't that many tokens you consume by\u00a0 the time you're 19. A bunch of them were about the\u00a0\u00a0 classics. Clearly that was important in some way. There aren't that many tokens you consume...\u00a0\u00a0  That's a good question. Here\u2019s one of the things\u00a0 I thought was really fascinating. Augustus became\u00a0\u00a0  emperor and he was trying to establish peace.\u00a0 There was no real conception of peace at the\u00a0\u00a0  time. The people's understanding of peace was\u00a0 peace as the temporary time between when your\u00a0\u00a0 enemies inevitably attack you. So you get a\u00a0 short rest. He had this view of changing the\u00a0\u00a0  economy from being something mercenary and\u00a0 militaristic to this actually positive-sum\u00a0\u00a0  thing. It was a very novel idea at the time. That\u2019s something that's really fundamental:\u00a0\u00a0  the bounds on what people can conceive\u00a0 of at the time as rational ways to work.\u00a0\u00a0 This applies to both the metaverse and the AI\u00a0 stuff. A lot of investors, and other people,\u00a0\u00a0  can't wrap their head around why we would open\u00a0 source this. It\u2019s like \u201cI don't understand, it\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 open source. That must just be the temporary time\u00a0 between which you're making things proprietary,\u00a0\u00a0  right?\u201d I think it's this very profound thing in\u00a0 tech that it actually creates a lot of winners.\u00a0 ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "What power range do data centers typically operate at?", "Question 2": "Has any company built a gigawatt data center?", "Question 3": "What might the future of model training include?", "Question 4": "How might countries use powerful AI models?", "Question 5": "What determines improvements in AI model architecture?", "Question 6": "What does the speaker think about the future of AI?", "Question 7": "How should society respond to powerful AI technologies?", "Question 8": "What risks come with concentrated AI power?", "Question 9": "How do open-source systems contribute to AI safety?", "Question 10": "What role does innovation play in founding companies?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "data centers on the order of fifty megawatts or one hundred megawatts or like a big one might be one hundred and fifty megawatts", "Answer 2": "No, just no one has built a single gigawatt data center yet.", "Answer 3": "In the future, it seems quite possible that more of what we call training for these big models is actually more along the lines of inference generating synthetic data to then go feed into the model.", "Answer 4": "Countries might use powerful AI models to generate synthetic data to enhance their training processes, allowing them to build applications that could make systems smarter.

They can\u2019t understand how that would be a\u00a0 valuable thing for people to do or how it would be\u00a0\u00a0  a reasonable state of the world. I think there\u00a0 are more reasonable things than people think.\u00a0 That's super fascinating. Can I give you what\u00a0 I was thinking in terms of what you might have\u00a0\u00a0  gotten from it? This is probably totally off,\u00a0 but I think it\u2019s just how young some of these\u00a0\u00a0 people are, who have very important roles\u00a0 in the empire. For example, Caesar Augustus,\u00a0\u00a0 by the time he\u2019s 19, is already one of the most\u00a0 important people in Roman politics. He's leading\u00a0\u00a0  battles and forming the Second Triumvirate. I\u00a0 wonder if the 19-year-old you was thinking \u201cI\u00a0\u00a0 can do this because Caesar Augustus did this.\u201d That's an interesting example, both from a lot\u00a0\u00a0  of history and American history too. One of my\u00a0 favorite quotes is this Picasso quote that all\u00a0\u00a0 children are artists and the challenge is to\u00a0 remain an artist as you grow up. When you\u2019re\u00a0\u00a0  younger, it\u2019s just easier to have wild ideas.\u00a0 There are all these analogies to the innovator\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0  dilemma that exist in your life as well as for\u00a0 your company or whatever you\u2019ve built. You\u2019re\u00a0\u00a0 earlier on in your trajectory so it's easier to\u00a0 pivot and take in new ideas without disrupting\u00a0\u00a0  other commitments to different things.\u00a0 I think that's an interesting part of\u00a0\u00a0 running a company. How do you stay dynamic? Let\u2019s go back to the investors and open source.\u00a0\u00a0  The $10B model, suppose it's totally safe. You've\u00a0 done these evaluations and unlike in this case\u00a0\u00a0 the evaluators can also fine-tune the model, which\u00a0 hopefully will be the case in future models. Would\u00a0\u00a0 you open source the $10 billion model? As long as it's helping us then yeah.\u00a0  But would it? $10 billion of\u00a0 R&D and now it's open source.\u00a0 That\u2019s a question which we\u2019ll have to evaluate\u00a0 as time goes on too. We have a long history of\u00a0\u00a0  open sourcing software. We don\u2019t tend to open\u00a0 source our product. We don't take the code for\u00a0\u00a0 Instagram and make it open source. We take\u00a0 a lot of the low-level infrastructure and\u00a0\u00a0  we make that open source. Probably the biggest\u00a0 one in our history was our Open Compute Project\u00a0\u00a0 where we took the designs for all of our servers,\u00a0 network switches, and data centers, and made it\u00a0\u00a0  open source and it ended up being super helpful.\u00a0 Although a lot of people can design servers the\u00a0\u00a0 industry now standardized on our design, which\u00a0 meant that the supply chains basically all got\u00a0\u00a0 built out around our design. So volumes went\u00a0 up, it got cheaper for everyone, and it saved\u00a0\u00a0  us billions of dollars which was awesome. So there's multiple ways where open source\u00a0\u00a0 could be helpful for us. One is if people figure\u00a0 out how to run the models more cheaply. We're\u00a0\u00a0  going to be spending tens, or a hundred billion\u00a0 dollars or more over time on all this stuff. So\u00a0\u00a0 if we can do that 10% more efficiently, we're\u00a0 saving billions or tens of billions of dollars.\u00a0\u00a0  That's probably worth a lot by itself. Especially\u00a0 if there are other competitive models out there,\u00a0\u00a0 it's not like our thing is giving\u00a0 away some kind of crazy advantage.\u00a0 So is your view that the\u00a0 training will be commodified?\u00a0  I think there's a bunch of ways that this could\u00a0 play out and that's one. So \u201ccommodity\u201d implies\u00a0\u00a0 that it's going to get very cheap because there\u00a0 are lots of options. The other direction that this\u00a0\u00a0  could go in is qualitative improvements. You\u00a0 mentioned fine-tuning. Right now it's pretty\u00a0\u00a0 limited what you can do with fine-tuning major\u00a0 other models out there. There are some options\u00a0\u00a0  but generally not for the biggest models. There\u2019s\u00a0 being able to do that, different app specific\u00a0\u00a0 things or use case specific things or building\u00a0 them into specific tool chains. I think that will\u00a0\u00a0  not only enable more efficient development, but\u00a0 it could enable qualitatively different things.\u00a0  Here's one analogy on this. One thing that I think\u00a0 generally sucks about the mobile ecosystem is that\u00a0\u00a0 you have these two gatekeeper companies, Apple and\u00a0 Google, that can tell you what you're allowed to\u00a0\u00a0  build. There's the economic version of that which\u00a0 is like when we build something and they just\u00a0\u00a0 take a bunch of your money. But then there's the\u00a0 qualitative version, which is actually what upsets\u00a0\u00a0  me more. There's a bunch of times when we've\u00a0 launched or wanted to launch features and Apple's\u00a0\u00a0 just like \u201cnope, you're not launching that.\u201d That\u00a0 sucks, right? So the question is, are we set up\u00a0\u00a0  for a world like that with AI? You're going to\u00a0 get a handful of companies that run these closed\u00a0\u00a0 models that are going to be in control of the APIs\u00a0 and therefore able to tell you what you can build?\u00a0  For us I can say it is worth it to go build\u00a0 a model ourselves to make sure that we're not\u00a0\u00a0 in that position. I don't want any of those\u00a0 other companies telling us what we can build.\u00a0\u00a0  From an open source perspective, I think a lot of\u00a0 developers don't want those companies telling them\u00a0\u00a0 what they can build either. So the question is,\u00a0 what is the ecosystem that gets built out around\u00a0\u00a0  that? What are interesting new things? How much\u00a0 does that improve our products? I think there\u00a0\u00a0 are lots of cases where if this ends up being like\u00a0 our databases or caching systems or architecture,\u00a0\u00a0  we'll get valuable contributions from the\u00a0 community that will make our stuff better.\u00a0\u00a0 Our app specific work that we do will then still\u00a0 be so differentiated that it won't really matter.\u00a0\u00a0 We'll be able to do what we do. We'll benefit\u00a0 and all the systems, ours and the communities\u2019,\u00a0\u00a0  will be better because it's open source. There is one world where maybe\u00a0\u00a0 that\u2019s not the case. Maybe the model ends up\u00a0 being more of the product itself. I think it's\u00a0\u00a0  a trickier economic calculation then, whether\u00a0 you open source that. You are commoditizing\u00a0\u00a0 yourself then a lot. But from what I can see so\u00a0 far, it doesn't seem like we're in that zone.\u00a0 Do you expect to earn significant revenue\u00a0 from licensing your model to the cloud\u00a0\u00a0  providers? So they have to pay you\u00a0 a fee to actually serve the model.\u00a0 We want to have an arrangement like that but\u00a0 I don't know how significant it'll be. This is\u00a0\u00a0  basically our license for Llama. In a lot of ways\u00a0 it's a very permissive open source license, except\u00a0\u00a0 that we have a limit for the largest companies\u00a0 using it. This is why we put that limit in. We're\u00a0\u00a0  not trying to prevent them from using it. We just\u00a0 want them to come talk to us if they're going to\u00a0\u00a0 just basically take what we built and resell it\u00a0 and make money off of it. If you're like Microsoft\u00a0\u00a0 Azure or Amazon, if you're going to be reselling\u00a0 the model then we should have some revenue share\u00a0\u00a0  on that. So just come talk to us before you\u00a0 go do that. That's how that's played out.\u00a0 So for Llama-2, we just have deals with basically\u00a0 all these major cloud companies and Llama-2 is\u00a0\u00a0  available as a hosted service on all those\u00a0 clouds. I assume that as we release bigger\u00a0\u00a0 and bigger models, that will become a bigger\u00a0 thing. It's not the main thing that we're doing,\u00a0\u00a0 but I think if those companies are going to be\u00a0 selling our models it just makes sense that we\u00a0\u00a0  should share the upside of that somehow. Regarding other open source dangers,\u00a0\u00a0 I think you have genuine legitimate points about\u00a0 the balance of power stuff and potentially the\u00a0\u00a0 harms you can get rid of because we have better\u00a0 alignment techniques or something. I wish there\u00a0\u00a0  were some sort of framework that Meta had. Other\u00a0 labs have this where they say \u201cif we see this\u00a0\u00a0 concrete thing, then that's a no go on the open\u00a0 source or even potentially on deployment.\u201d Just\u00a0\u00a0  writing it down so the company is ready for it and\u00a0 people have expectations around it and so forth. \u2028\u00a0 That's a fair point on the existential risk\u00a0 side. Right now we focus more on the types of\u00a0\u00a0  risks that we see today, which are more of these\u00a0 content risks. We don't want the model to be doing\u00a0\u00a0 things that are helping people commit violence\u00a0 or fraud or just harming people in different\u00a0\u00a0 ways. While it is maybe more intellectually\u00a0 interesting to talk about the existential risks,\u00a0\u00a0  I actually think the real harms that need more\u00a0 energy in being mitigated are things where someone\u00a0\u00a0 takes a model and does something to hurt a\u00a0 person. In practice for the current models,\u00a0\u00a0 and I would guess the next generation\u00a0 and maybe even the generation after that,\u00a0\u00a0  those are the types of more mundane harms that we\u00a0 see today, people committing fraud against each\u00a0\u00a0  other or things like that. I just don't want to\u00a0 shortchange that. I think we have a responsibility\u00a0\u00a0 to make sure we do a good job on that. Meta's a big company. You can handle both.\u00a0  As far as open source goes, I'm actually\u00a0 curious if you think the impact of open source,\u00a0\u00a0 from PyTorch, React, Open Compute and other\u00a0 things, has been bigger for the world than\u00a0\u00a0 even the social media aspects of Meta. I've\u00a0 talked to people who use these services\u00a0\u00a0 and they think that it's plausible because a\u00a0 big part of the internet runs on these things.\u00a0  It's an interesting question. I mean almost\u00a0 half the world uses our consumer products so\u00a0\u00a0  it's hard to beat that. But I think open\u00a0 source is really powerful as a new way of\u00a0\u00a0  building things. I mean, it's possible. It\u00a0 may be one of these things like Bell Labs,\u00a0\u00a0  where they were working on the transistor because\u00a0 they wanted to enable long-distance calling. They\u00a0\u00a0 did and it ended up being really profitable for\u00a0 them that they were able to enable long-distance\u00a0\u00a0  calling. 5 to 10 years out from that, if you\u00a0 asked them what was the most useful thing\u00a0\u00a0 that they invented it's like \u201cokay, we enabled\u00a0 long distance calling and now all these people\u00a0\u00a0 are long-distance calling.\u201d But if you asked a\u00a0 hundred years later maybe it's a different answer.\u00a0  I think that's true of a lot of the things that\u00a0 we're building: Reality Labs, some of the AI\u00a0\u00a0 stuff, some of the open source stuff. The specific\u00a0 products evolve, and to some degree come and go,\u00a0\u00a0  but the advances for humanity persist and\u00a0 that's a cool part of what we all get to do.\u00a0  By when will the Llama models be\u00a0 trained on your own custom silicon? \u2028\u00a0  Soon, not Llama-4. The approach that we took is\u00a0 we first built custom silicon that could handle\u00a0\u00a0  inference for our ranking and recommendation\u00a0 type stuff, so Reels, News Feed ads, etc. That\u00a0\u00a0 was consuming a lot of GPUs. When we were able\u00a0 to move that to our own silicon, we're now able\u00a0\u00a0  to use the more expensive NVIDIA GPUs only for\u00a0 training. At some point we will hopefully have\u00a0\u00a0  silicon ourselves that we can be using for at\u00a0 first training some of the simpler things, then\u00a0\u00a0 eventually training these really large models. In\u00a0 the meantime, I'd say the program is going quite\u00a0\u00a0  well and we're just rolling it out methodically\u00a0 and we have a long-term roadmap for it. \u2028\u00a0 Final question. This is totally out of\u00a0 left field. If you were made CEO of Google+\u00a0\u00a0  could you have made it work? Google+? Oof. I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0 That's a very difficult counterfactual. \u2028 Okay, then the real final question will be:\u00a0\u00a0  when Gemini was launched, was\u00a0 there any chance that somebody\u00a0\u00a0  in the office uttered: \u201cCarthago delenda est\u201d. No, I think we're tamer now. It's a good question.\u00a0\u00a0  The problem is there was no CEO of Google+. It\u00a0 was just a division within a company. You asked\u00a0\u00a0 before about what are the scarcest commodities\u00a0 but you asked about it in terms of dollars. I\u00a0\u00a0  actually think for most companies, of this scale\u00a0 at least, it's focus. When you're a startup maybe\u00a0\u00a0 you're more constrained on capital. You\u2019re just\u00a0 working on one idea and you might not have all\u00a0\u00a0  the resources. You cross some threshold at some\u00a0 point with the nature of what you're doing. You're\u00a0\u00a0 building multiple things. You're creating\u00a0 more value across them but you become more\u00a0\u00a0  constrained on what you can direct to go well. There are always the cases where something\u00a0\u00a0 random awesome happens in the organization and I\u00a0 don't even know about it. Those are great. But I\u00a0\u00a0  think in general, the organization's capacity\u00a0 is largely limited by what the CEO and the\u00a0\u00a0  management team are able to oversee and manage.\u00a0 That's been a big focus for us. As Ben Horowitz\u00a0\u00a0  says \u201ckeep the main thing, the main thing\u201d and\u00a0 try to stay focused on your key priorities.\u00a0 Awesome,\u2028that was excellent, Mark.\u00a0 Thanks so much. That was a lot of fun.\u00a0 Yeah, really fun. Thanks for having me. Absolutely.

It looks like you cleared out my whole office. - Yeah, we got rid of everything. - Man, they're doing some work somewhere. How you been? - I'm doing all right, man. How are you? - I'm doing great. I should have told you, by the way,  you didn't have to wear a tie, but you look sharp. You know more about this stuff than I do so. - Well, let's start. (Obama chuckling) President Barack Obama, you're the 44th president of the United States. We're here at the Obama Foundation. Welcome to Decoder. - It is great to be here, thank you for having me.  - I am really excited to talk to you. There's a lot to talk about. We are here on the occasion of President Biden signing the executive order about AI. I would describe this order as sweeping. I think it's over 100 pages long. There's a lot of ideas in it.  Everything from regulating biosynthesis with AI. There's some safety regulations in there. It mandates something called red teaming, transparency, watermarking. These feel like new challenges, like very new challenges for the government's relationship with technology.  I wanna start with a Decoder question. What is your framework for thinking about these challenges and how you evaluate them? - This is something that I've been interested in for a while. So, back in 2015, 2016, as we were watching  the landscape transformed by social media and the information revolution impacting every aspect of our lives, I started getting in conversations about artificial intelligence and this next phase,  this next wave that might be coming. And I think one of the lessons that we got from the transformation of our media landscape was that incredible innovation, incredible promise,  incredible good, can come out of it, but there are a bunch of unintended consequences and that we have to be maybe a little more intentional about how our democracies interact with  what is primarily being generated out of the private sector. And you know, what rules of the road are we setting up and how can we make sure that we maximize the good and maybe minimize some of the bad.  And so, I commissioned the, you know, my science guy, John Holdren, along with John Podesta, who had been a former Chief of Staff and worked on climate change issues. Let's pull together some experts to figure this out,  and we issued a big report in my last year. The interesting thing even then was people felt enormously promising technology, but, you know, we may be overhyping  how quick it's gonna come. And as we've seen just in the last year or two, even those who are developing these large language models who are, you know, in the weeds with these programs,  are starting to realize this thing is moving faster and is potentially even more powerful than we originally imagined. So, my framework and in conversations  with government officials, private sector academics, that the framework I emerge from is that this is going to be a transformative technology. It's already in all kinds of small ways,  but very broadly, changing the shape of our economy. In some ways, even our search engines, you know, basic stuff that we take for granted is already operating under some AI principles, but this is gonna be turbocharged.  It's gonna impact how we make stuff, how we deliver services, how we get information, and the potential for us to have enormous medical breakthroughs. The potential for us to be able to provide  individualized tutoring for kids in remote areas. The potential for us to solve some of our energy challenges and deal with greenhouse gases  that this could unlock amazing innovation, but that it can also do some harm. Yeah, we can end up with powerful AI models in the hands of somebody in a basement who develops a new smallpox variant  or, you know, non-state actors, who suddenly, because of a powerful AI tool, can hack into critical infrastructure or maybe less dramatically,  AI, you know, infiltrating the lives of our children in ways that we didn't intend, in some cases, the way social media has. So, what that means then is, is that I think the government,  as an expression of our democracy, needs to be aware of what's going on. Those who are developing these frontier systems need to be transparent. I don't believe that we should  try to put the genie back in the bottle and be anti-tech, because of all the enormous potential, but I think we should put some guardrails around some risks that we can anticipate and have enough flexibility  that it doesn't destroy innovation, but also, is guiding and steering this technology in a way that maximizes not just individual company profits,  but also the public good. - So, lemme make the comparison for you. I would say that the problem in tech regulation for the past 15 years has been social media. How do we regulate social media? How do we get more good stuff, less bad stuff? Make sure that really bad stuff is illegal.  You came to the presidency on the back of social media. - I was the first digital president. - You had a Blackberry, I remember, people were very excited about your Blackberry. I wrote a story about your iPad that was transformative. That's young people are gonna take to the political environment. They're gonna use these tools,  we're gonna change America with it. - You can make an argument. I wouldn't have been elected had it not been for social networks. - Now, we're on the other side of that. There was another guy who got elected on the back of social networks. There was another movement in America that has been very negative on the back of that election. We have basically, failed to regulate social networks.  I'd say there's no comprehensive privacy bill even. There was already a framework for regulating media in this country. We could apply a lot of what we knew about should we have good media to social networks. There are some First Amendment questions in there, what have you, the important ones,  but there was an existing framework. With AI, it's, we're gonna tell computers to do stuff and they're gonna go do it. - Right, we hope. - That we have no framework for that. - We hope they do what... - We hope, right? - Think we're telling them to do.  - We also ask computers a question. They might just confidently lie to us or help us lie at scale. There is no framework for that. What do you think you can pull from the sort of failure to regulate social media into this new environment such that we get it right this time, or do anything at all?  - Well, this is part of the reason why I think what the Biden administration did today in putting out the EO. The work they've done is so important. Not because it's the end point, but because it's really the beginning of building out a framework.  And when you mentioned how this executive order has a bunch of different stuff in it, what that reflects is we don't know all the problems  that are gonna arise out of this. We don't know all the, you know, promising potential of AI, but we're starting to put together sort of  the foundations for what we hope will be a smart framework for dealing with it. And in some cases, what AI is gonna do is to accelerate advances in, let's say medicine.  You know, we've already seen, for example, with, you know, things like protein folding and the breakthroughs that can take place that would not have happened had it not been for some of these AI tools.  And, you know, we wanna make sure that that's done safely. We wanna make sure that it's, you know, done responsibly. And it may be that we already have some laws in place that can manage that.  There may be some novel developments in AI where an existing agency, an existing law just doesn't work. You know, if we're dealing with the alignment problem and we wanna make sure that  some of these large language models where even the developers aren't entirely confident about what these models are doing, what the computer's thinking or doing.  Well, in that case, we're gonna have to figure out what are the red teaming, what are the testing regimens? And in talking to the companies themselves, they will acknowledge that their safety protocols and their testing regimens, et cetera, may not be where they need to be yet.  And I think it's entirely appropriate then for us to plant a flag and say, \"All right, frontier companies, you need to disclose what your safety protocols are to make sure that we don't have rogue programs going off  and hacking in our financial system, for example. Tell us what tests you're using. Make sure that we have some independent verification that right now this stuff is working.\"  But that framework can't be a fixed framework, because these models are developing so quickly that oversight and any regulatory framework is gonna have to be flexible  and it's gonna have to be nimble. And it's gonna, and by the way, it's also gonna require some really smart people who understand how these programs and these models are working not just in the companies themselves,  but also in the nonprofit sector and in government. Which is why I was glad to see that the Biden administration part of the executive order is specifically calling on a bunch of, you know,  hotshot young people who are interested in AI to do a stint outside of the companies themselves and, you know, go work for government for a while. Go work, you know, with some of the research institutes  that are popping up in places like the Harvard Lab, or the Stanford AI Center, and some other non-profits. Because we're going to need to make sure that  everybody can have confidence that whatever journey we're on here with AI, that it's not just being driven by a few people without any kind of interaction  or voice from ordinary folks, regular people who are gonna be using- - Well, there's a difference there. - these products and impacted by these products. - There's ordinary folks and there's the people who are building it who need to go help write regulations. And there's a split there.  The conventional wisdom in the valley for years is the government is too slow, it doesn't understand technology. And by the time it actually writes a functional rule, the technology it was aiming to regulate will be obsolete. This is markedly different, right?  The AI doomers are the ones asking for regulation the most. The big companies have asked for regulation. Sam Altman has toured the capitals of the world politely asking to be regulated. Why do you think there's such a fervor for that regulation? It's just incumbents wanting to cement their position.  - Well, I look, you're raising an important point, which is, and rightly there's some suspicion, I think among some people that, yeah, these companies want regulation,  because they wanna lock out competition. And as you know, historically, sort of a central principle of tech culture has been open source. We want everything out there.  Everybody's, you know, able to play with models and applications and create new products, and that's how innovation happens. Here, regulation starts looking like,  well, maybe we start having closed systems and, you know, the big frontier companies, the Microsofts, the Googles, the open AIs, anthropics, that they're gonna somehow lock us out.  But in my conversations with the tech leaders on this, I think there is for the first time some genuine humility,  because they are seeing the power that these models may have. I talked to one executive, and look, there's no shortage of hyperbole in the tech world, right?  But this is a pretty sober guy, like an adult- - Now, I have to guess who it's. - who's seen a bunch of these cycles and been through boom and bust. And I asked him, I said, \"Well, when you say this technology you think is gonna be transformative,  give me sort of some analogy.\" He said, \"You know, I sat with my team and we talked about it. And after going around and around what we decided was maybe the best analogy was electricity.\" Then I thought, well, yeah, electricity. That was a pretty big deal. - [Nilay] Yeah.  - And if that's the case, I think what they recognize is that it's in their own commercial self-interest that there's not some big screw up on this. That if in fact it is as transformative  as they expect it to be, then having some rules, some protections, that create a competitive field, allow everybody to participate, come up with new products, compete on price, compete on functionality,  but you know, that none of us are taking such big risks,- - Yeah, there's a view in the valley. - that the whole thing blows up in our faces. I do think that there is sincere concern that,  if we just have a unfettered race to the bottom, that this could end up, you know, choking off the goose that might be laying a bunch of golden eggs. - There is the view in the valley though, that any constraint on technology is bad. - Yeah, and I disagree with that. - Any caution, any principle where you might slow down  is the enemy of progress. And the net good is better, if we just race that as fast as possible. - In fairness, that's not just in the valley, that's in every business I know. It's not like Wall Street loves regulation. It's not as if manufacturers are really keen  for government to micromanage how they produce goods. But one of the things that we've learned, you know, through the industrial age,  and the information age, you know, over the last century, is that you can overregulate, you can have over bureaucratize things,  but that if you have smart regulations that set some basic goals and standards, making sure you're not creating products that are unsafe to consumers. making sure that if you're, you know, selling food,  you know, people who go in the grocery store can trust that they're not gonna die from salmonella or E.coli. Making sure that if somebody buys a car that you know, the brakes work, making sure that,  you know, if I take my electric whatever and I plug it into a socket anywhere, any place in the country, that it's not gonna shock me and blow up on my face.  It turns out all those various rules, standards, actually create marketplaces and are good for business, and innovation then develops around those rules. So, it's not an argument that I think  part of what happens in the tech community is the sense that we're smarter than everybody else, and these people slowing us down are impeding rapid progress.  And you know, when you look at the history of innovation, it turns out that having some smart guideposts around which innovation takes place, not only doesn't slow things down, in some cases, it actually raises standards  and accelerates progress. There were a bunch of folks who said, \"Look, you know, you're gonna kill the automobile, if you put airbags in there.\" Well, it turns out actually people figured out, you know what, we can actually put airbags in there  and make 'em safer, and over time the costs go down. - There's a great TikTok- - Everybody's better off. - of somebody reacting to drunk driving laws in the eighties. It's great, I'll send it to you. There's a really difficult part in the EO about providence.  Watermarking content, making sure people can see it's AI generated. You are among the most deep faked- - Oh absolutely. - people in the world. - Well, because what I realized is when I left office, I'd probably been filmed and recorded more than any human in history,  just 'cause I happened to be the first president when the smartphone came out. - I'm assuming you have some very deep personal feelings about being deep faked in this way. There's a big First Amendment issue here, right? I can use Photoshop one way,  and the government doesn't say I have to put a label on it. I use it a slightly different way. The government's gonna show up and tell Adobe, you've gotta put a label on this. How do you square that circle? It seems very challenging to me. - Look, I think this is gonna be an iterative process. I don't think you're gonna be able  to create a blanket rule. But the truth is, that's been how our governance of information, media, speech, that's how it's developed for a couple hundred years now.  With each new technology, we have to adapt and figure out some new rules of the road. So, let's take my example, a deep fake of me, that is used for political satire or just to, you know, somebody doesn't like me  and they wanna deep fake me. I was the President of the United States, and there are some pretty formidable rules that have been set up to protect people from making fun of public figures. I'm a public figure,  and what you are doing to me as a public figure is different than what you do to a 13-year-old girl in high school, freshmen in high school.  And so, we're gonna treat that differently. And that's okay. We should have different rules for public figures than we do for private citizens. We should have different rules for  what is clearly sort of political commentary and satire versus cyber bullying, or... - Where do you think those rules land? Do they land on individuals? Do they land on the people making the tools like Adobe or Google?  Do they land on the distribution networks like Facebook? - My suspicion is how responsibility is allocated, we're gonna have to sort out. But I think the key thing to understand is,  and look, I taught constitutional law. I'm close to a First Amendment absolutist in the sense that I generally don't believe that,  you know, even offensive speech, mean speech, et cetera, it should be certainly not regulated by the government. And I'm even game to argue that on social media platforms, et cetera,  that the default position should be free speech rather than censorship. I agree with all that. But keep in mind, we've never had completely free speech, right? We have laws against child pornography.  We have laws against, you know, human trafficking. We have laws against certain kinds of speech that we deem to be really harmful  to the public health and welfare. And the courts, when they evaluate that, they say, hmm, you know, they come up with a whole bunch of time, place, manner restrictions that may be acceptable in some cases  aren't acceptable in others. You get a bunch of case law that develops. There's arguments about it in the public square. We may disagree. Should Nazis be able to protest in Skokie? Well, you know, that's a tough one. But, you know, we can figure this out.  And that I think is how this is gonna develop. I do believe that the platforms themselves are more than just common carriers like the phone company.  They're not passive. There's always some content moderation taking place. And so, you know, once that line has been crossed, it's perfectly reasonable for the broader society to say,  \"Well, we don't wanna just leave that entirely to a private company. I think we need to at least know how you're making those decisions, what things you might be amplifying through your algorithm and what things you aren't.  And you know, it may be that what you're doing isn't illegal, but we should at least be able to know how some of these decisions are made.\" I think it's gonna be that kind of process that takes place.  What I don't agree with is the large tech platform suggesting somehow that we want to be treated  entirely as a common carrier. - It's the Clarence Thomas view, right? - Yeah, but on the other hand, we know you're selling advertising based on the idea  that you're making a bunch of decisions about your products. - Well, this is very challenging, right? If you say you're a common carrier, then you are in fact regulating them. You're saying you can't make any decisions. - Yes. - You say you are exercising editorial control. They are protected by the First Amendment. - [Obama] Yes. - And then regulations get very, very difficult.  It feels like even with AI, when we talk about content generation with AI, or with social networks, we run right into the First Amendment over and over again. And most of our approaches, this is what I worry about, is we try to get around it so we can make some speech regulations  without saying we're gonna make some speech regulations. Copyright law is the most effective speech regulation on the internet, because everyone will agree. Okay, Disney owns that bring it down. - Well, because there's property involved. There's money involved. - There's money, maybe less property than money, but there's definitely money.  - Well, IP and hence money, yeah. Well, look, here's my general view. - Yeah, but do you worry that we're making fake speech regulations without actually talking about the balance of equities that you're describing here?  - I think that we need to have, and AI I think is gonna force this, that we need to have a much more robust  public conversation around these rules and agree to some broad principles to guide us. And the problem is, right now, let's face it, it's gotten so caught up in partisanship,  partly because of the last election, partly because of Covid and vax and anti-vax proponents that we've lost sight of our ability to just come up with some principles  that don't advantage one party or another, or one position, or another, but do reflect our broad adherence to democracy. But the point I guess I'm emphasizing here is this is not the first time we've had to do this.  We had to do this when radio emerged. We had to do this when television emerged. And, you know, it was easier to do back then in part because you had three or five companies or you, you know, the public  through the government technically owned the airwaves. And so, you could make these. - No, this is the square on my bingo card. If I could get to the Red Lion case with you, I've won, right? There was a framework here that said the government owns the airwaves, it's gonna allocate them to people in some way, and we can make some decisions.  And that is an effective and appropriate speech regulation. - [Obama] That was the hook. - Can you bring that to the internet? - I think you have to find a different kind of hook. - Sure. - But ultimately, even though the idea that the public and the government owned the airwaves,  that was really just another way of saying this affects everybody, and so, we should all have a say in how this operates. And we believe in capitalism, and we don't mind you making a bunch of money  through the innovation and the products that you're creating and the content that you're putting out there, but we wanna have some say in what our kids are watching or how things are being advertised, et cetera. - If you were the President now, - [Obama] Yeah.  - And I was with my family last night, and the idea that the Chinese TikTok teaches kids to be scientists and doctors, in our TikTok the algorithm is different. And we should have a regulation like China has that teaches our kids, we don't, it came up. And all the parents around the table said,  \"Yeah, we're super into that. We should do that.\" How would you write a rule like that? Is it even possible with our First Amendment? - Well look, for a long time, let's say under television, there were requirements around children's television. It kept on getting watered down to the point  where anything qualified as children's television, right? We had a fairness doctrine that made sure that there was some balance in terms of how views were presented.  And I'm not arguing, you know, good or bad in either of those things. I'm simply making the point that we've done it before and there was no sense that somehow that was anti-democratic or it was that squashing innovation.  It was just a understanding that we live in a democracy. And so, we kind of set up rules so that we think the democracy works is better rather than worse, and everybody has some say in it.  The idea behind the First Amendment is we're gonna have a marketplace of ideas that these ideas battle themselves out. And ultimately, we can all judge better ideas versus worse ideas.  And I deeply believe in that core principle. We are gonna have to adapt to the fact that now there is so much content, there are so few regulators.  Everybody's can throw up any idea out there, even if it's sexist, racist, violent, et cetera. And that makes it a little bit harder than it did when we only had three TV stations  or a handful of radio stations or what have you. But the principle still applies, which is, how do we create a deliberative process where the average citizen can hear a bunch of different viewpoints  and then say, \"You know what, here's what I agree with. Here's what I don't agree with.\" And hopefully, through that process, we get better outcomes. - Let me crash the two themes of our conversations together, AI and the social platforms.  Meta just had earnings. Mark Zuckerberg was on the earnings call. And he said for our feed apps, Instagram, Facebook threads, \"For the feed apps, I think that over time, more of the content that people consume  is either going to be generated or edited by AI.\" So, he envisions a world in which social networks are showing people perhaps exactly what they wanna see- - Absolutely. - inside of their preferences. Much like advertising that keeps 'em engaged. Should we regulate that away? Should we tell 'em to stop?  Should we embrace this as a way to show people more content that they're willing to see that might expand their worldview? - This is something I've been wrestling with for a while. I give a speech about misinformation in our information silos at Stanford last year.  I am concerned about business models that just feed people exactly  what they already believe and agree with, and all designed to sell them stuff. Do I think that's great for democracy? No.  Do I think that that's something that the government itself can regulate? I'm skeptical that you can come up with perfect regulations there. What I actually think probably needs to happen though  is that we need to think about different platforms and different models, different business models,  so that it may be that I'm perfectly happy to have AI mediate how I buy jeans online, right? That could be very efficient. I'm perfectly happy with it.  If, you know, and so, if it's a shopping app, or a thread, fine. When we're talking about political discourse, when we're talking about culture, et cetera,  can we create other places for people to go that broaden their perspective.

But I don't think that's something that government is going to be able to sort of legislate. I think that's something that consumers  and interacting with companies are gonna have to discover and find alternatives. The interesting thing, look, I'm not obviously 12 years old, I didn't grow up, you know,  with my thumbs on these screens. So, I'm a old ass, you know, 62-year-old guy, that sometimes can't really work all the apps on my phone, but I do have two daughters who are in their twenties.  And it's interesting the degree to which at a certain point they have found almost every, you know, app, social media app, thread getting kind of boring after a while.  It gets old, precisely because all it's doing is telling 'em what you already know, or what the program thinks you want to know, or what you want to see. So, you're not surprised anymore. You're not discovering anything anymore. You're not learning anymore.  And so, I think there's a promise to how we can, there's a market, let's put it that way. I think there's a market for products that don't just do that.  It's the same reason why, you know, people have asked me around AI, you know, are there gonna still be artists around and singers and actors, or is it all gonna be,  you know, computer-generated stuff? And my answer is, you know, for elevator music, AI's gonna work fine, you know, for... - A bunch of elevator musicians just freaked out, dude.  - You know, for the average, you know, even legal brief, or let's say a research memo in a law firm. AI can probably do as good a job as a second year law associate.  - Certainly. as good a job as I ever did. - Exactly, but you know, Bob Dylan or Stevie Wonder... - [Nilay] Lemme ask, there's one thing. - That, that is different. And the reason is because part of the human experience, part of the human genius is it's almost a mutation.  It's not predictable, it's messy, it's new, it's different, it's rough, it's weird. That is the stuff that ultimately, taps into something deeper in us. And I think there's gonna be a market for that.  - So you, in addition to being the former president, you are a bestselling author, you have a production company with your wife, you're in the IP business, which is why you think it's property. It's good, I appreciate that. The thing that will stop AI in its tracks in this moment  is copyright lawsuits, right? You ask a generative AI model to spit out a Barack Obama speech and it it will do it to some level of passibility. Probably C plus, that's my estimation C plus. - It'd be one of my worst speeches. But it might sound sort of.  - You fire a canon of C plus content in any business model of the internet, you upend it. But there are a lot of authors, musicians now. Artists suing the companies saying, \"This is not fair use to train on our data to just ingest all of it.\" Where do you stand on that?  Do you think that, as an author, do you think it's appropriate for them to ingest this much content? - Set me aside for a second, 'cause you know, Michelle and I, we've already sold a lot of books and we're doing fine. So, I'm not overly stressed about it personally,  but what I do think President Biden's executive order speaks to, but there's a lot more work that has to be done on this, and copyright is just one element of this.  If AI turns out to be as pervasive and as powerful as its proponents expect, and I have to say, the more I look into it, I think it is going to be that disruptive,  we are going to have to think about not just intellectual property, we're gonna have to think about jobs and the economy differently. And not all these problems are going to be solved inside of industry.  So, what do I mean by that? I think with respect to copyright law, you will see people with legitimate claims,  financing the lawsuits and litigation, and through the courts and various other regulatory mechanisms, you know, people who are creating content, they're gonna figure out ways to get paid  and to protect the stuff they create. And it may impede the development of large language models for a while, but over the long term, I don't think that'll just be a speed bump.  The broader question is gonna be what happens when 10% of existing jobs now definitively can be done better by  some large language model or other variant of AI? And are we gonna have to reexamine how we educate our kids  and what jobs are gonna be available? And you know, the truth of the matter is that during my presidency, there was I think a little bit naivete where people would say, you know,  the answer to lifting people out of poverty and making sure they have high enough wages is we're gonna retrain them and we're gonna educate them and they should all become coders, 'cause that's the future. Well, if AI is coding better than all,  but the very best coders, if ChatGPT can generate a research memo better than the third, fourth year associate, maybe not the partner, you know, who's got a particular expertise or judgment,  you know, now what are you telling young people coming up? And I think we're gonna have to start having conversations about how do we pay those jobs that can't be done by AI.  How do we pay those better, you know, healthcare, nursing, you know, teaching, childcare, art, things that are really important to our lives,  but maybe commercially, historically have not paid as well. Are we gonna have to think about the length of the work week and how we share jobs? Are we gonna have to think about the fact that more people  choose to operate like independent contractors, but where are they getting their healthcare from and where are they getting their retirement from, right? Those are the kinds of conversations  that I think we're gonna have to start having to deal with. And that's why I'm glad that the, you know, President Biden's EO begins that conversation. Again, I can't emphasize enough, because I think you'll see some people saying,  \"Well, we still don't have tough regulations. Where's the teeth in this? We're not forcing these big companies to do X, Y, Z as quickly as we should.\" That I think this administration understands. and I've certainly emphasized in conversations with them.  This is just the start. And you know, this is gonna unfold over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years. And by the way, it's gonna be unfolding internationally. You know, there's gonna be a conference this week  in England around international safety standards on AI. Yeah, the Vice President Harris is gonna be attending. I think that's a good thing,  because part of the challenge here is we're gonna have to have some cross-border frameworks and regulations and standards and norms. You know, that's part of what makes this different  and harder to manage than, you know, the advent of radio and television. Because the internet by definition is a worldwide phenomenon. - Yeah, you said you were the first digital president. I gotta ask, have you used these tools?  Have you had the aha moment where the computer's talking to you? Have you generated a picture of yourself? - I have used some of these tools during the course of, you know, these conversations and this research. And you know, it's fun. - Has Bing flirted with you yet? It flirts with everybody I hear. (Obama laughing)  - Bing didn't flirt with me, but you know, the way they're designed, and I've actually, raised this with some of the designers. You know, in some cases, they're designed to anthropomorphize,  to make it feel like you are talking to a human, right? It's like, you know, can we pass the Turing test, right? That's a specific objective, 'cause it makes it seem more magical. And in some cases it improves function,  but in some cases it just makes it cooler. And so, there's a little pizazz there and people are interested in it. I have to tell you that generally speaking though the way I think about AI is as a tool, not a buddy.  And I think part of what we're gonna need to do as these models get more powerful, and this is where I do think government can help, is also just educating the public on what these models can do and what they can't do.  That, you know, these are really powerful extensions of yourself and tools, but also reflections of yourself.  And so, don't get confused and think that somehow what you're seeing in the mirror is you know, some other consciousness. A lot of times this is just feeding back to you. - You just want Bing to flirt with you.  This is what I felt personally very, very deeply. - Yeah. - All right, last question. I need to know this. It's very important to me. What are the four apps in your iPhone dock? - Four apps at the bottom. I've got Safari. - Key.  - I've got my tax, you know, the green box. - Yeah, you're a blue bubble. Do you give people any crap for being a green bubble? - No, I'm okay. - [Nilay] All right.  - I've got my email, and I have my music, that's it. - It's like the stock set, pretty good. - Yeah, you know, if you asked the ones  that I probably go to more than I should, I might have to put like words with friends on there where I think I waste a lot of time and maybe my NBA League Pass. - Oh, that's pretty good, that's pretty good.  - But you know, I try not to overdo it on those. - League Pass is just one click above the dock. That's what I'm getting outta this. - That's exactly. - President Obama, thank you so much for being on Decoder. I really appreciate this conversation. - I really enjoyed it. And I wanna emphasize once again,  because you've got an audience that understands this stuff, cares about it, is involved in it and working at it, if you are interested in helping to shape all these amazing questions that are gonna be coming up, go to ai.gov and see if there are  opportunities for you fresh outta school. Or you might be an experienced, you know, tech coder who's, you know, done fine, you know, bought the house, got everything set up and says,  \"You know what? I wanna do something for the common good.\" Sign up, you know, this is part of what we set up during my presidency, US Digital Services.  And it's remarkable how many really high-level folks decided that for six months, for a year, for two years,  them devoting themselves to questions that are bigger than just, you know, what the latest app, you know, or video game was turned out to be really important to them  and meaningful to them. And attracting that kind of talent into this field with that perspective, I think is gonna be vital. - Yeah, sounds like it. - All right, great to talk to you. - [Nilay] Thanks so much. - You bet. - [Nilay] Thank you very much. - Really enjoyed it. - I appreciate that. - [Obama] Come on, why don't we get a picture of-  - [Nilay] Yeah. - [Obama] the team, 3, 2, 1. One more, okay. Fantastic, really enjoyed it. You did great. - [Nilay] Thank you for saying that. - [Production Assistant] Thank you. - One thing real quick. - Yes, of curse.

ARTHUR BROOKS: Thank you. OPRAH WINFREY: It all started right here. ARTHUR BROOKS: It did. OPRAH WINFREY: During the pandemic, I came across a column in \"The Atlantic\" magazine and noticed that I started to look forward to reading it every week. It's called \"How to Build a Life\" by Arthur Brooks.  I knew I had to meet the man who wrote such insightful advice. So Arthur Brooks, it is my great pleasure to meet you. I am such a huge fan of yours. Arthur Brooks is a world renowned social scientist--  ARTHUR BROOKS: Happiness is really a combination of three things, enjoyment, satisfaction, and meaning. OPRAH WINFREY: --the author of many books, including the number one \"New York Times\" bestseller, \"From Strength to Strength--\" ARTHUR BROOKS: I'm a big fan of your \"How to Build a Life\" column in \"The Atlantic.\"  I find myself sharing it with my kids all the time. OPRAH WINFREY: --and a professor at Harvard Business School, whose course on happiness is so popular, there's always a long wait list. ARTHUR BROOKS: I thought about it, and I thought, it's not about them. It's not about Harvard. This is about everybody who needs the science of happiness.  The whole world is on the waiting list for this class. OPRAH WINFREY: This year, Professor Brooks and I teamed up to co-write a book we call \"Build the Life You Want-- The Art and Science of Getting Happier.\" And I am very happy to say it debuted at the top of \"The New York Times\" bestseller list.  ARTHUR BROOKS: We cooked up the whole book here in this room. And it's really-- it's incredibly gratifying. OPRAH WINFREY: And isn't it gratifying also? I mean, I was really excited to hit number one on \"The New York Times\" bestsellers. I mean, one of the reasons why it's so gratifying is because first of all, number one, it's always gratifying.  ARTHUR BROOKS: It's a nice number. OPRAH WINFREY: It's a nice-- ARTHUR BROOKS: It has a nice ring to it. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. But it also means that the work that we conceived in this room was well received. ARTHUR BROOKS: Right. Well, you remember, we talked about it.  We discussed not what's going to be in the book, but the why of the book. OPRAH WINFREY: The why. ARTHUR BROOKS: This was the big thing that we did here. We said, OK, what's the point? What are we trying to do? And it was lift people up and bring them together with science and ideas. OPRAH WINFREY: So we decided to do a three-part series,  y'all, to dive further into the book here on \"Super Soul\" because my intention for this platform has always been to enhance the human experience and to bring you information  that will open up your life. So I know that you listeners are interested in learning new ways to explore a life with meaning and purpose, which is what you, Arthur, are all about. And before we get started, I think  you should tell everyone, actually, about your day job or what you do. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so my day job is I'm a teacher. I'm a college professor. I teach The Science of Happiness at the Harvard Business School. I also teach at the Harvard Kennedy  School, which trains people to go work in government. And I research, and think, and teach about behavior, human behavior, what motivates people to do what they do. I'm a social scientist. OPRAH WINFREY: Yes. I was going to say, you don't just teach there. You are actually a scientist. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah.  And I've been a social scientist for the past 30 years. That's what I've been doing with my life. OPRAH WINFREY: A PhD social scientist. ARTHUR BROOKS: Indeed. Indeed. And so I teach-- people ask, you know, you're a professor? I say, yeah, Harvard Business School. They say, what do you teach, accounting? Finance? Marketing? Supply chain management?  You know, something really practical like that. I say, no, I teach happiness. And they think I'm lying. But I teach happiness with the same seriousness that you would teach supply chain management. Look, your life is an enterprise. Your life is your start up. Treat it as such.  Treat it with seriousness. You know, treat the inside of your head the same way you would treat your P&L statement is the bottom line. OPRAH WINFREY: Your life is your start up, the biggest start up you're ever going to have. ARTHUR BROOKS: Totally. It's the best enterprise you could be part of, and the most serious one at that. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah. So on this series, we're exploring the ideas  in the book where Arthur, the author, offers science-based practices and wisdom that anybody can use to become happy, your, I call it, happierness. ARTHUR BROOKS: It was so good that you coined that.  It's helpful to me because for the longest time, people would say, you know, the goal is happiness. And I would say, no, it's getting happier, but that doesn't have a ring to it. And I told you that for the first time. And you said, so the goal is happierness. OPRAH WINFREY: It's happierness. ARTHUR BROOKS: That's the right word. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAH WINFREY: I love it.  ARTHUR BROOKS: And now people are saying it. My students are saying it. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah, we need a t-shirt. Before we dive into the book, let's talk about your own journey, though, because people want to know your story because you are the professor of happiness. And how did you get here? At age 55, you left a very successful career. ARTHUR BROOKS: Right.  OPRAH WINFREY: And you were a chief executive of a think tank. And now you-- then you started studying happiness. Was it to bring greater happiness to yourself? ARTHUR BROOKS: For sure, and other people. You go through kind of a-- not necessarily a dark night of the soul.  But at certain points of your life, there are hinge points when you have to ask yourself, why am I doing what I'm doing? And what is the mission of my own life? And the truth is, as I thought about it, and prayed about it, and talked to the people I love about it, it was very clear,  the mission of my life is to lift people up and bring them together. And ideas of love and happiness, using-- OPRAH WINFREY: Well, you were also doing that with the think tank, right? ARTHUR BROOKS: I was trying, but-- and it was good. It was good. I was grateful for having done that. I did that for 11 years.  But it was time for somebody else to do that. And at 55, I still had plenty of gas in the tank. And I wanted to use everything that I knew for other people, and quite frankly, for me too. I wanted to dig into this thing that we now call happierness  and see whether or not it was achievable in my own life. And if it was, could I bring it to others? OPRAH WINFREY: Well, you know, studies are showing that America is in a happiness slump. ARTHUR BROOKS: Indeed. OPRAH WINFREY: I don't think you even need a study to figure that out. You just look around you or you turn on your computer,  you look at your phone, I mean, the news, the conspiracy theories. What is going on? ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. No, it's true. I mean, the data are unambiguous. The experience that we all have that it feels like people are less happy, it's true.  And there's kind of two things that we need to understand. You could say that there's problems in the climate and problems in the weather. The climate has been changing for happiness for decades now. Since the late '80s, maybe the early '90s, people have been gradually getting  a little less happier year, after year, after year just a little tiny bit. And that has to do with the fact that people are less likely to live a spiritual or religious life or find a life of meaning in those institutions. They're less likely to have a close relationship with their families. People have fewer and fewer friends who know them well.  People have less of a sense that they're serving others with their work. That's the climate. And that's been a problem for a long time. Then there's weather, storms. There have been two big storms in the past couple of decades that we have to pay attention to.  The first was around 2008, 2009. Now, I know everybody watching us is like, oh, obviously the financial crisis. Uh-uh. That wasn't it. OPRAH WINFREY: I thought it. ARTHUR BROOKS: It was social media. Same time. OPRAH WINFREY: Oh. ARTHUR BROOKS: That's when everybody started looking at social media. OPRAH WINFREY: That's right, 2009.  That's when I got on what used to be Twitter. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. Yeah, the artist formerly known as Twitter. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. Exactly right. And that's when-- and a couple of things were happening. So Twitter, for example, became a platform for people to be intensely negative. Instagram is not the same way.  It's more of a platform for people compare themselves to other. But that had a big impact, especially on young people, especially on women and girls, 15 to 25 years old. It created a new kind of culture that was intensely comparative and problematic.  OPRAH WINFREY: So social media actually, where people think it's bringing you closer together and you're communicating on Facebook, it's actually made people less happy. ARTHUR BROOKS: Lonelier. OPRAH WINFREY: Lonelier. ARTHUR BROOKS: Here's the weird thing. When you're super hungry and it's like, oh, man, I haven't eaten.  You know, I haven't eaten in hours, and hours, and hours. And you pass by a fast food place. And you're like, good. That'll get the job done. And so you gorge yourself, and you're stuffed, and you don't feel so good. An hour later, you're hungry again. What happened? The answer is you didn't meet your nutrient needs.  All you met is your caloric needs. And so the result is you stay hungry, even though you don't need the calories. Social media is the junk food of social life. It's like getting all of your calories-- OPRAH WINFREY: That is a tweetable moment, but we don't tweet anymore. We X. What do we? ARTHUR BROOKS: X? Is that what we call it, X?  OPRAH WINFREY: I don't know what do. I don't know. ARTHUR BROOKS: But so that's-- that's like getting all your meals at 7-Eleven. OPRAH WINFREY: Social media is the junk food-- ARTHUR BROOKS: --of social life. Social media is the junk food of social life. You'll get too many calories and not enough nutrients.  That's the reason you'll binge and get lonelier. That's a problem. And a lot of young people have never developed in a way where they can finally figure out how to use it responsibly. OPRAH WINFREY: What's going to happen to the generation that was born at that time and that's all they've ever known?  ARTHUR BROOKS: We don't know. That's a big social experiment. That's a massive social experiment. OPRAH WINFREY: That we're in the midst of right now. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. It's not as if social media is all evil. I mean, you can use it responsibly. OPRAH WINFREY: Absolutely. ARTHUR BROOKS: If you would not let somebody into your house who bears you ill will,  you shouldn't let them into your head. And that means you shouldn't be looking at the social media where somebody can be tweeting at you or X-ing at you and telling you that you're this, you're that. And frankly, that's a big problem. That's the storm. That's the turn of a century. OPRAH WINFREY: Wow.  So let's get happier. ARTHUR BROOKS: Let's do that. OPRAH WINFREY: Let's get happier. On page five, you say, \"happiness is not a destination. Happiness is a direction.\" I know that was a shift in mindset for many who are reading this book. Can you expand a little bit on that?  ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. And this is-- the problem with happiness-- it's such a funny thing because we all want it. Every philosopher and theologian has talked about it. Everybody-- I mean, how many times have people said that on your show? OPRAH WINFREY: I know. That's what I say in the beginning of the book, that-- ARTHUR BROOKS: Thousands of times.  OPRAH WINFREY: I became interested in the subject because every time I would sit with the audience and I'd say, what do you want, everybody would always say-- multiple people would answer, I just want to be happy. I just want to be happy. But yet, when you ask them, what does that look like for them? Hard to define. ARTHUR BROOKS: For sure.  And part of the reason is because it's not something that you can define in any meaningful way. We think it's a feeling. We think it's a destination. It isn't either. You know, happy feelings are nothing more than emotions. And emotions are nothing more than information  that we need in reaction to the outside environment. And as a destination, why would you want to be completely happy as the destination? You'd be dead in a week because you actually need negative emotions and experiences to train you to keep you vigilant, to keep you safe.  OPRAH WINFREY: And to be happy, to keep you alert, to keep you on it. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, yeah. I mean, maybe when I die and I'm in heaven, I see the face of God, the beatific vision will be pure happiness. But on Earth, I'm telling you, I need my negative emotions to keep me alive and safe.  I need my negative experiences to learn and grow. And so that's what people-- they want to stay alive and safe, but they don't want the feelings that keep them alive and safe. And that's this conflict that they have, which is why they feel so unsettled. OPRAH WINFREY: OK.  So I think, particularly, in this world of social media, people think, if I just get that-- I mean, I see people posting on private jets. And I see them, you know, on beaches,  and you know, their hair blowing in the wind and all that. And people think, well, if I just had that, I could be happy. But we know, you have the science to back it up, that there are really four pillars. And if you don't have all of those pillars working  in your life, you will eventually end up feeling not necessarily sad, but lonely, or distanced, or disconnected. ARTHUR BROOKS: That's right. OPRAH WINFREY: So the four pillars. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, the four pillars. There's kind of the four pillars you think that you need. And there's four pillars that you really do need.  The idols, the things that look right, but aren't, are money, power, pleasure, and fame. Those are the things that mother nature says you get those, you're going to be happy. OPRAH WINFREY: Money, power, pleasure, and fame? ARTHUR BROOKS: That's right. But she lies. Mother Nature lies. She lies a lot because she wants us to keep running, running, running, running, running.  OPRAH WINFREY: Is Mother Nature telling us that, or is society telling us that? Because I think Mother Nature is telling us that it's the four pillars. ARTHUR BROOKS: Well, Mother Nature gives us these imperatives because she wants us to be hungry, you know? And she wants us to survive and pass on our genes.  And the way that you do that is with money, power, pleasure, and fame. And she doesn't want us to figure out that those things never really satisfy, so that we'll keep running, and running, and running. That's called the hedonic treadmill. What we really want--  and this is backed up by a lot of psychology, neuroscience, behavioral economics, all the research that we want is that there's kind of four things that are the virtuous things that we should be looking for that Mother Nature doesn't necessarily tell us,  but that if we take the divine path in life, religious or not religiously understood, a better path in life, we'll be happy. And those are our faith, family, friends, and work that serves.  Now, if you give any teenage kid the choice between money, power, pleasure, and honor or faith, family, good friends, and good times, and work that serves others, I mean, what are they going to take? I mean, our society does aid in Mother Nature's lie  because you know, the marketing colossus tells us that if you get that car, man, you're going to be really happy. If you get that job, you get that money, if you get that 100,000 Instagram followers or whatever your number happens to be-- it's never high enough, by the way-- you're going to be happy.  But that's a lie is the bottom line. There's nothing wrong with those things. But if you get those things, if we are so lucky to get those things, they should only ever be in service of the big four, the good four. They should only ever be in service.  They should be intermediate goals, a rest stop in the New Jersey turnpike, Manhattan, where you're trying to get is faith. And by that-- OPRAH WINFREY: How do you use that money, power, pleasure, and fame to enhance your faith, family, and work?  ARTHUR BROOKS: And friendship. OPRAH WINFREY: And friendships. ARTHUR BROOKS: Basically, your love. Your love and your life and the love and lives of the people around you. That's really what those worldly goals should be used for if you want to have any shot at true happiness. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah. I know we have a lot of questions from our readers.  Readers, people who have already read the book, I'm so excited about that. ARTHUR BROOKS: It's wonderful, isn't it? Yeah. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah. OK, Eric from Denver. Hello. ERIC: Hi. I'm Eric. And I learned from this book that you can't be happy, but you can be happier. And that really resonated with me  because it makes happiness feel like a thing I can incrementally work towards every day versus this big place to arrive. My question is for you, Oprah. I'm wondering how as you've gotten older,  your approach to getting happier has changed. OPRAH WINFREY: Thank you for noticing that I've gotten older, Eric. Thank you. I think that's actually-- I like that question, Eric, because as I've gotten older,  and one of the reasons why I was so excited about working with Arthur here, is because Arthur, you confirmed my belief system. So I have been-- I have known since I was a kid that life  is better when you share it. And I learned that with my first Three Musketeers bar because growing up poor, I so seldom got candy. I would save it until, like, cousins came by so because it tasted better when I could share it.  And now I know, Eric, that that is one of the principles of enjoyment, which is what actually defines happiness, enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose. ARTHUR BROOKS: Exactly right. OPRAH WINFREY: And so being able-- so to answer your question, I would  say that now that I know that the science actually backs me up on life is better when you share it, I want to share it more. So it used to be I would just love doing a random act of kindness or doing something, you know,  meaningful for somebody that would help them in their lives or enhance their lives. Now I make it a habit. It's a part of my spiritual practice to include the enjoyment for myself  of making other people happier. So I would say as I've gotten older, that's what I've actually learned about how to enjoy happiness, not just for myself, but how to spread it to other people.  So one of the things we talk about in the book is how enjoyment, and satisfaction, and purpose are the macronutrients of happiness. So let's talk about enjoyment first and the difference between pleasure and enjoyment.  ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, this is a big mistake that a lot of people make. I mean, one of the things that we do in the book is we disabuse people of mistaken notions of happiness. Happiness is not a feeling. Happiness is not a destination. It's a direction toward happierness, et cetera. And another one has to do with this idea that I'm going to be happy if I can just hit the pleasure lever  over, and over, and over again. Here's some words that have never been uttered. I'm really happy because of methamphetamine. Nobody's ever said that. That is not what people say. And the reason is because if you use illicit drugs and drugs of abuse,  you're going to hit the pleasure lever. It's going to feel good, but it's not going to make you happy. It's going to lead to addiction. It's going to lead to a supraphysiological level of dopamine in your brain. And all that does is gives you a tiny little reward and then goes away, a tiny little reward, and it goes away.  OPRAH WINFREY: That's why you have to keep getting more, and more, and more, and it doesn't fix it. ARTHUR BROOKS: And then what happens is because that becomes an incredibly isolated thing. OPRAH WINFREY: And that's regardless if it's methamphetamine, or if it's your work, or if it's shopping, or if it's whatever it is. That's just giving you pleasure. ARTHUR BROOKS: For sure.  I mean, that can be gambling. That can be eating. That can be all kinds of things that-- whatever your thing is. And here's how you know if it's a problem. If you're hitting the pleasure lever over, and over, and over again and you're alone, then you know there's a problem. That's what it is.  And that actually-- inside that diagnosis, there is the solution. You know, that's why Anheuser-Busch doesn't have a beer commercial of a guy alone in his apartment pounding a 12-pack. That's why that's not the ad.  That's because that doesn't lead to happiness. That leads to a problem. OPRAH WINFREY: Doesn't that look sad and pitiful? ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, yeah. For sure. No. What they have is a guy with his buddies making a memory, the guy with his friends or his family making a memory.  And therein lies the answer to this is not that you've got to-- OPRAH WINFREY: Lots of advertising does that. ARTHUR BROOKS: Totally. That's what all the beer commercials do because they want you to be happier when you use their product. And the reason is they want you to have enjoyment, not just pleasure. Now, a lot of the problems that we  have in kind of a puritanical culture about this would say that the solution is if you're hitting the pleasure lever repeatedly by yourself, get rid of the pleasure lever. But that's not necessarily the solution. OPRAH WINFREY: Because the pleasure has its pleasures. ARTHUR BROOKS: Totally. You need to add two things. You need to add--  OPRAH WINFREY: In order to have enjoyment. ARTHUR BROOKS: Exactly. You need to have the source of pleasure, plus people that you love, plus memories. Now, what you're doing is you're moving the experience of the pleasure from the limbic system of your brain, which is deep down. It's evolved over a 40 million year period.  All it is is sending signals to you about how to survive. OPRAH WINFREY: I have the perfect example of this. So all my life, from the moment I was working in Baltimore making $22,000 a year, my first vacation, I spent on going to a spa.  So I love spa-ing. So I've been to many spas by myself, where, you know, massages, the whole pedicure, manicure, the whole thing, walking around in your robe. And this past April, I went spa-ing.  I did a thing that when the first spa I went to, there was a very wealthy woman there. I remember-- Ann Getty, I think, was her name. And she was there with all of her friends. And I thought, wow. What would that be like to have enough money  to go with all of your friends? ARTHUR BROOKS: It would be more fun. OPRAH WINFREY: It looks certainly more fun than me walking around alone in my bathrobe. And this past April, I did that with dear friends. And it's the most fun I ever had at a spa.  ARTHUR BROOKS: Because you took the pleasure. You added the people. You made the memories. OPRAH WINFREY: And we made the memories. ARTHUR BROOKS: That's exactly right. That's enjoyment. Now, that means you don't have to forego the sources of pleasure. You have to add the people in the memory. OPRAH WINFREY: People plus memory makes it enjoyment.  ARTHUR BROOKS: Pleasure, plus people, plus memory. Now, you can mess this up, right? You can have all your friends can be drunks, you know? And they can kind of-- you can go into a cycle like that. A lot of people-- you know, I drink too much. And he drinks too much. And we all drink too much. And we all get really drunk together.  So I mean, obviously there are exceptions to this. But that's the basic rule of thumb. You don't have to do less. You have to add more. This is not a subtractive formula. This is an additive formula. Almost everything in the science of happiness is additive. You've got to add more ingredients to make it good.  OPRAH WINFREY: So I think this is so great. Whatever it is you-- so this is an easy formula. Whatever it is you take pleasure in, find a way to add other people into that pleasure, and it becomes more enjoyable. And you're making memories, babe. ARTHUR BROOKS: That's right.  And so you know, I'm not saying don't go to Vegas. Just don't go alone. 4:00 in the morning, you're going by yourself. No, no. No, no, no. Go with your buddies. Go with your spouse. Go with your friends. And by the way, if you're being compulsive,  they're going to say, dude, really? Can you afford that? And you're going to want to have more fun with the company as opposed to compulsively pulling the lever again, and again, and again to get that little spritzer of dopamine onto the nucleus accumbens of your brain, giving you that little relief.  And that just goes away, and you're still by yourself. OPRAH WINFREY: So enjoyment is one of the components. And in order to enjoy, you've got to add other people and make it more conscious. ARTHUR BROOKS: Exactly right. OK. Monica, what's your question from Michigan? MONICA: Hi. My name is Monica.  And when you talked about the difference between pleasure and enjoyment in the book, that really struck me. And I realized that I tend to seek pleasure to cope with disappointment, or sadness, or anger.  So I would love to hear some examples from both of you, Arthur and Oprah, around how to disrupt that pattern when, as you say, pleasure is easy and enjoyment is hard. OPRAH WINFREY: That's good. ARTHUR BROOKS: Disruption, right?  I mean, the whole idea is you get-- she knows. I mean, by the way, the first-- she's good. Monica is good because Monica realizes. She already has gotten knowledge about this. The basis of getting happier is knowledge. You know, this is the thing. A lot of people are just like, I'm going to feel. Let me feel something different.  No, no, no, no, no, no. The Dalai Lama says, think more, feel less, which is really important. So that's why we wrote a book that has a lot of science in it, because people need this particular knowledge. And she's really, really on her way. And she understands that there's a cycle in hitting the lever to get the pleasure, hitting the lever to get the pleasure.  You have to disrupt. That cycle that gets back to just what we were talking about before. You disrupt that cycle with love, with another person, with people that you care about. You add the person who disrupts that little relationship. When you talk to people who have suffered from addiction,  one of the things that they always talk about is that the addiction was, like, my closest relationship. You know? It was like-- it was like-- OPRAH WINFREY: They were consumed by it. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, for sure. It was my lover. It was my best friend.  And I wanted to go away with my best friend, which was booze or whatever it happened to be, gambling. I wanted to go away with them. You disrupt that by adding a real living human being.  That's how you disrupt the cycle is add a person you love. OPRAH WINFREY: And also, accepting unhappiness. You say, without unhappiness you wouldn't survive, learn, or come up with good ideas. Even if you could get rid of your unhappiness, it would be a huge mistake.  The secret to the best life is to accept your unhappiness, so you can learn, and grow, and manage the feelings that result. I think that's hard for people because what does that mean to accept the unhappiness? When you say accept, it often feels like so I'm just supposed to like do nothing?  I'm just supposed to accept it? I'm supposed to surrender to it? I'm unhappy. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. No, that's not-- it's not the idea. The truth is that you need to accept it as normal. And this is a big part of our culture today is that we think that if we feel unhappiness or pain,  there's something wrong with us, that there's evidence that something's broken if you feel unhappy. You know, if you're in college, you go to campus counseling and say, I'm really feeling anxious, and I'm really feeling depressed-- and you know, my university is a really hard university. If you're not anxious when you're at Harvard University,  that's the problem. That means you're not working hard enough. Maybe that's when you need therapy, quite frankly. You know, when I talk to young people, they say I was feeling really anxious about my studies. Like, of course, you are. That's a normal thing. That's the acceptance, the acceptance of the fact  that you have feelings, including negative feelings. And you'd be dead if you didn't. OPRAH WINFREY: Who's walking around at Harvard not feeling anxious? ARTHUR BROOKS: Totally. Totally. By the way, including the faculty. It's like, my students, they don't quite figure out that I'm, like, freaking out too.

I'm Jean. \"Build the Life You Want\" has been the gift that I didn't even know that I needed. On page 20 when I read that people who do not regret tend to make the same mistake over and over again,  I thought, that's me. When I was 18 years old, I failed an exam that would enable me to get into the university. And my dad said, no crying. Move forward. And I didn't. Now, my question is, how do I today begin  to use regret as a tool when my African upbringing has dictated that I move forward and get on with it? OPRAH WINFREY: I love that. ARTHUR BROOKS: That's a great question. OPRAH WINFREY: That is great. ARTHUR BROOKS: It really is good because that's a lot of advice that we give our children.  You know, it's like, suck it up. OPRAH WINFREY: Suck it up. Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: You know? And like, move on, move on, move on. Now, there's there's, like, a kernel of-- I mean, good for her father because what he was really telling her was not forget about everything that happened. What he was telling her was don't ruminate on it.  Don't you know, go over it again, and again, and again and have it, you know, create a constant source of sadness in your life. On the contrary, you've got to keep moving. And that's true. But here's the thing, rumination is not the same thing as understanding. When something bad happens to you,  you benefit from it tremendously if you analyze it like a scientist. That's one of the reasons that I tell my students to keep a failure journal, like, have a disappointment journal. OPRAH WINFREY: We talked about that. ARTHUR BROOKS: We talked about it in the book. Absolutely. We talked about how you can do it. When something bad happens to you,  write it down, and think about it. Don't ruminate on it. Don't have it be kind of like a ghost around haunting the limbic system of your emotions. No, no, no. Use it as an opportunity to think about what actually happened. And when you do that, by the way, when you think about it  as if you were analyzing a problem that somebody else had, this is something we talk a lot about in the book, then you will learn and grow. So the point is don't ruminate. Understand. That's the way that you can actually use the information,  take the time to understand these things appropriately, and learn and grow. OPRAH WINFREY: The second macronutrient of happiness, satisfaction, is that thrill from accomplishing a goal you worked for is what you say. Why is satisfaction also the key to getting happier?  ARTHUR BROOKS: We're made to make progress. Human beings are made to make progress. You know, we want to achieve. The funny thing is that people always think, when I get to my goal, then I'm going to be finally happy. But that's just incredible fallacy.  That's called the arrival fallacy. You know, like, you and I are doing high fives because the book hit number one in \"The New York Times\" best seller list. But if we're like, OK, now Oprah and Arthur are going to be happy forever, we're kidding ourselves. OPRAH WINFREY: No. ARTHUR BROOKS: Next week, we're going to be doing a new project, doing a new thing. That's the truth.  The arrival fallacy is once I finally get the money, once I finally get the marriage, once I finally get the car, the house, the boat, then all will be well. The truth is that the greatest joy comes from the progress toward the accomplishment, even in spite of the fact that it requires a lot of struggle.  Satisfaction is that moment that you hit it, which is a real moment of joy. Now, the paradox in that is that it doesn't last. And it can't last. If you actually-- OPRAH WINFREY: That's why you couldn't get no satisfaction. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, that's right. And the truth is you can't keep no satisfaction. That's the real problem.  I mean, Mick Jagger had it almost right. OPRAH WINFREY: That's why I was saying Jagger couldn't get no satisfaction. ARTHUR BROOKS: That's right. And the truth is if he couldn't get it, he wouldn't keep trying, and trying, and trying, like he sings. The problem is you can't keep no satisfaction. And that's what seems kind of like a bitter fruit with the satisfaction dilemma.  You need to struggle. If you don't struggle, by the way, there is no satisfaction. If my students cheat on my exam and they get an A, there's no satisfaction. OPRAH WINFREY: There's no satisfaction. ARTHUR BROOKS: They do an all nighter, and they work really hard, and they get an A, they're like, yeah. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: And you know how it feels. I mean, you and I, we worked hard on this book.

And we were-- OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah, from the time that-- yeah, it's miraculous from the time that we decided-- ARTHUR BROOKS: I'm sending in chapters like, I don't know. But then, boom.  And it's satisfaction. Then the problem is thinking that once we arrive, it's going to be good forever and then having a little-- the frustration that comes from the satisfaction is dispelled. And there's a way to fix-- there's a way around that. But once again, you got to fight Mother Nature. OPRAH WINFREY: OK.  So you need enjoyment. You need satisfaction. And you also need purpose. Those are the macronutrients. ARTHUR BROOKS: Right, like the protein, carbohydrates, and fat of-- OPRAH WINFREY: And how-- OK, so explain to people how the macronutrients fit into the pillars.  ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. So the macronutrients are basically the elements that we find that you need in balance and abundance. You can't just have a life of enjoyment. You also need satisfaction. You need goals. You need to struggle. And you need meaning, which is the why, the essence of your life. You need those things. The happiest people have those three things.  And they work on them. They take them seriously. And we spend tons of time about how to actually do that. Then-- OPRAH WINFREY: So this is why this is so great for y'all. And I mean y'all meaning myself too because when-- ARTHUR BROOKS: And me. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah. When we figured it out-- I mean, those are--  that's the baseline. You need enjoyment, you need satisfaction, and you need meaning and purpose. And let's talk about what meaning and purpose means because I think people get all confused about the purpose, like, I don't know my purpose. I don't know my purpose. ARTHUR BROOKS: Right. So those macronutrients are just, like,  the macronutrients of food, the component parts of food. Then you got the dishes and the dinner, which are the pillars that we'll talk about later, the things to actually be focusing on, the things that you're working on. But the last macronutrient is meaning or purpose. Meaning is the essence of your life. You know, who am I?  It's this whole finding yourself thing, right? It's like, I got to find myself. And people from the beginning of time, it's like, who am I, right? And that's no joke. That's a hard thing to do. I mean, some people believe that you could discover it because your essence precedes your existence.  I mean, most religious people, you know, people raised in the Christian faith, like you and me, I mean, we believe that we're made in God's image. And that's our essence. And it precedes us. OPRAH WINFREY: Right. Right. ARTHUR BROOKS: Other people think that they can create their own essence. This is-- you know, different philosophies believe that's a tricky one, right? Some people believe there is no essence. That's a real problem, right?  But the truth of the matter is that to do that-- and we talk about this in the book a little bit-- that there's a quiz that you've got to give yourself. And you have to have real sincere answers to two questions.  Now, if you don't have them, it means there's a crisis of meaning in your life. But that's a good thing to know that because then you have the opportunity to go in search of just the answers to just two questions. Question number one, why are you alive? And again, I can't tell you that.  I mean, it's like, you got to have your own answer to that. Go in search of that answer. And the second, for what are you willing to die today? And the answer probably shouldn't be nothing, right? There's got to be something. And once you actually find the answers to those questions, it's extraordinary, Oprah.  You know, when you see this, my-- you know, a lot of my family-- my family. And one-- my son, you haven't met yet because he's still an active duty Marine. He's a scout sniper in the US Marine Corps.  And he struggled in high school because meaning, you know? He was goofing off, and he wasn't even having fun because like, who am I? So I-- I'm a business school professor. I make my kids do a business plan when they're a junior in high school, you know, a business plan  because the enterprise alive. And they're entrepreneurs. I'm VC. I'm venture capital, so I deserve a business plan. I realize it's pretty nerdy, but there you go. OPRAH WINFREY: I like it. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. And if it's not original, I send it back for revisions. So this is my son, Carlos. He's a good boy.  And Carlos-- like, his business plan is kind of-- I don't know. I don't believe it. So I say, you need to find the answers to these questions. How are you going to the answers to these questions? So in his business plan, he says I'm not going to college, which is fine. I didn't either until I was 30. You know, it took me a long time to get through college too. I wasn't ready.  He went to work on a farm. He spent two years on a dry land wheat farm in Idaho. Then he joined the Marines. And he's 23 now. He's married. And he's got it going on. And he's got answers to those two questions. And I ask him, Carlos, why were you born?  Why are you alive? He said because God made me to serve. For what are you willing to die today? He says for my family, for my faith, for my friends, and for the United States of America. Boom. OPRAH WINFREY: Boom.  ARTHUR BROOKS: And you know, that's not everybody's answer who are watching us. But that boy's got answers. OPRAH WINFREY: At 23. ARTHUR BROOKS: At 23. And his life is different than it was. His life has meaning. It's beautiful. As a father, I couldn't be prouder.  I couldn't be prouder of the enterprise that he's building of his life because he's becoming a good man. OPRAH WINFREY: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I love that. You're the venture capitalist, and bring me the plan. Yeah. All right. ARTHUR BROOKS: Business school. OPRAH WINFREY: OK.  Chapter two is entitled, \"The Power of Metacognition\" and what I call feel to feel and then take the wheel. Explain metacognition. I think this is just one of the biggest, biggest, biggest  contributions to people getting happier in their lives once you get the metacognition. ARTHUR BROOKS: It's changed my life. It's just changed my life. And part of the reason is because people go through life relatively unexamined in their emotions and just hoping that their emotions will get better  and with a complete inability to separate their own essence from their emotions. And that's a crazy thing to do. You're not your emotions. Look, I'm not my hand. You know, it's-- I'm not-- my hand is not completely independent.  It's like one of those old horror movies. But that's how people are with their emotions where their emotions are controlling them. Metacognition is thinking about thinking. It's the ability to look at your own self with a certain intellectual remove at a distance.  It's putting distance between your feelings and your reactions and doing it on purpose. When you have that ability, your life isn't going to be the same. It just isn't because you're not going to wonder, like, is something bad going to happen to me tomorrow? By the way, answer, yes.  Am I going to feel bad about it? I'm going to decide how I'm going to work on this. I'm going to decide my reactions. I'm going to substitute emotions that are more appropriate for what I'm doing. Now, you have emotions for a reason. You're not going to block them out. But once you have metacognitive skill  where you can put space between the emotions that are just simply signals from your brain about what's going on around you, and-- OPRAH WINFREY: The emotions are there to tell you that something's off and you need to do something about it. ARTHUR BROOKS: It's just information. It's just information. OPRAH WINFREY: Your emotions are just information.  ARTHUR BROOKS: That's all they are. OPRAH WINFREY: And if you can separate yourself from the thing that you're feeling, feel the feeling, and then take control-- ARTHUR BROOKS: Exactly right. And the way that you do that is by putting space between the emotions and your reactions. OPRAH WINFREY: Tell us how to do that.  ARTHUR BROOKS: So you do that by studying yourself. Now-- OPRAH WINFREY: Don't you do that also by observing the feeling Yeah exactly as though it were happening to somebody else? You identify what this feeling is. You say, oh, gosh, I'm feeling so sad right now.  I'm feeling so put upon. I'm feeling so betrayed, whatever it is. But you separate the feeling from yourself. You're observing all those feelings inside your body, so that you see that the feeling is really different from you. You're in control of the feeling.  ARTHUR BROOKS: Exactly. And you're able to react in an appropriate way. I mean, we're so maladapted to the way that our feelings occur to us. I mean, I talk to people all the time where-- once again, back to social media. I got a bad tweet. And what did it do? It raised my-- your stress hormones are through the roof.  You've got butterflies in your stomach and the whole thing. The reason for that is because nature wants you to run away from a saber-toothed tiger by injecting stress hormones into your system when you think there's a threat. Or you don't want to wander the frozen tundra and die alone.  But you know, folks look around. No tundra. Twitter is not tundra. And so the result is metacognition is very important, so that we can-- OPRAH WINFREY: Make it feel like it is. ARTHUR BROOKS: For sure. And if you don't have an unexamined life, then you're not going to be able to make those distinctions. And so you can actually laugh at yourself.  When you're actually observing your own emotions at a certain remove as if they were happening to another person and you see yourself freaking out because of a tweet, you will start laughing. You'll be like, really, Arthur? Really? I mean, it's like you're a grown man.  You have a PhD. You're a social scientist. You're supposed to know all this stuff. And somebody said a mean thing to you on Twitter, and you're acting as if you an ax murderer is chasing you? Come on, man. And it's just funny. And life gets better. And that's what metacognition can do for all of us  if we have the right techniques. OPRAH WINFREY: OK, so let's explain the emotional caffeine metaphor you mentioned on page 71. We all loved this the first time we heard it. Tell us about it. ARTHUR BROOKS: So emotional caffeine-- this is just a metaphor.  Most people, something like 95% of Americans use caffeine on a regular basis. I'm crazy about coffee. I grew up next to the first Starbucks in the world. In the 1970s, there was one Starbucks. My house was near it. I've been drinking-- OPRAH WINFREY: In Seattle? ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah.  I grew up in Seattle in the Queen Anne neighborhood. And we used to walk down to Pike Place. OPRAH WINFREY: That was the first one? ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, the first one. Yeah. I've talked to Howard Schultz about this. He thinks it's quite charming. But I've been drinking caffeine-- I mean, taking caffeine regularly since I was seventh grade, which means I have the most enervated adrenal system. And who knows?  I mean, the autopsy is going to be a fun time. Anyway, so-- but what happens with your brain is you think it peps you up because it gives you all this energy. It's not. What it does is it blocks another neurotransmitter called adenosine. Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that's  floating around your brain that goes into these certain receptors. And it mellows you out. So it makes you-- when it's time to be tired, time to lower your energy, whatever it is. The problem is you got too much of it. Like, in the morning, you're feeling kind of lethargic. Too much adenosine is filling those receptors.  So you get this caffeine where the molecule's the same size and shape. And it goes into the parking spots for the adenosine, blocking it, so it just can't mellow you out. That's what caffeine does. It blocks the neurotransmitter that you don't want.  That's what it's doing. OPRAH WINFREY: So it's not really perking you up? ARTHUR BROOKS: It's not. It's preventing you from being perked down. That's not an expression, is it? To mellow you out. You don't want to be too mellow. OPRAH WINFREY: If there's happierness, we can be perked down too. ARTHUR BROOKS: Is that what we're creating? A new language here. OPRAH WINFREY: A new language. ARTHUR BROOKS: I love it.  So that's what-- and so the reason I use that particular metaphor-- and you and I talk about this metaphor in the book-- is because that's what you can do once you're a metacognitive, and you're aware of your own emotions, and you're studying your own emotions. So many times throughout life, you've  got a particular emotion, but it's not the emotion you want. Choose another one. Choose it. OPRAH WINFREY: So you should have, like, a little storage of better emotions. ARTHUR BROOKS: Repertoire. You need a better repertoire.  OPRAH WINFREY: That's right, a repertoire of better emotions, so when you're in a funk, when you're perked down, you can go to something that perks you up. ARTHUR BROOKS: Exactly right. You can actually block the anxiety and depression. OPRAH WINFREY: Give me an example.  ARTHUR BROOKS: So-- and this is an example from a mutual friend of ours, Rainn Wilson, you know, the actor who was in \"The Office.\" He-- I noticed, you know, just through basic observation, that a lot of professional comedians are depressed.  So I said, hey, man, what is it about professional comedy that bums you out so much, that makes you melancholic? And he said, no, no, you got it wrong. It's the opposite. It's that we tend toward depression, and we make a joke when we feel down.  And that solves the problem. That's emotional caffeine. When you make a joke and other people laugh, life gets better. You lighten somebody else's load, and you lighten your own load. And you get relief. You get a little cup of Starbucks dark roast at that moment.  OPRAH WINFREY: Is it also sort of like-- you know, when I-- every time-- anybody knows this too. I'm sure this happens to you. You go to the doctor. The blood pressure cuff goes on. My blood pressure immediately goes up when I see the blood pressure cuff coming. ARTHUR BROOKS: White coat syndrome?  OPRAH WINFREY: I definitely have the white coat syndrome. I've literally-- I go to Cleveland Clinic, like, once a year. And they leave me in the room for a few minutes before, so I can calm myself down because I got the white coat syndrome. And I start thinking about every happy thing,  walking in the woods with my dogs. I've always loved water sprinklers on a green lawn, you know, when you're walking and you can see the rainbow in the water. So I start-- I have, like, this little storage, this little-- ARTHUR BROOKS: Happy place. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah, a little repertoire of things  to calm me down to think about. So is that what emotional caffeine is? ARTHUR BROOKS: Emotional caffeine works exactly that way. And the key thing is thinking about the things that bedevil you, you know, the particular experiences that you have,  the problematic emotions that are maladapted. They're not the wrong emotion. They're just an emotion. It's just information. But you can have another emotion that's also extremely appropriate and choose that if you're studying yourself and you've got distance between your reaction and what you're feeling.  If you're very reactive, you're like a little kid. You know, you're angry, you yell. You're sad, you cry without thinking about it on the contrary. When something is-- and it's fine. I mean, we like spontaneous people. But that's no way to live. You know, when you have little kids, when my kids were little,  my wife would always say, use your words. I'd say be metacognitive. That's what that really means because when you use your words you've move the experience of the emotion into your prefrontal cortex into your executive brain. And there, you can make decisions like emotional caffeine.  You can decide on different emotions that are more appropriate to the circumstances. So here's the thing. OPRAH WINFREY: You can think a better thought. ARTHUR BROOKS: You can think a better thought. OPRAH WINFREY: And you can think a better thought if you have a repertoire of thoughts to go to think. it's hard to think a better thought when  you're in the midst of the-- if you're all perked down. ARTHUR BROOKS: So give yourself some space. Get some space in there and say, OK, I'm going to go to the library. I'm going to pick out that one. Here's a classic one that you do all-- you do super well. I've seen you do it again and again. OPRAH WINFREY: You're talking about-- ARTHUR BROOKS: I'm talking about gratitude. OPRAH WINFREY: I was going to say,  are you talking about gratitude? ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. So we feel resentment, and we feel bitterness, or we feel anger a lot. And the reason is because we're evolved to have those dominant emotions. This is called the negativity bias. The negativity bias is that, you know,  we actually have more brain space dedicated to producing emotions that are negative than positive because negative emotions on the pleistocene keep you alive. Somebody smiling sweetly at you in the tribe, that's great. Somebody frowning at you might be a big problem when you step outside.  OPRAH WINFREY: And you will remember that frown longer than you remember the 12 people who smiled. ARTHUR BROOKS: Oh, yeah, because that's evolved to keep you alive. The problem is this is hugely maladapted and S ruin big parts of our lives because we're so-- we're negative all the time. It's also unrealistic.  OPRAH WINFREY: That's why in the beginning of \"The Oprah Show,\" when we were still just taking phone calls and people were writing real letters by snail mail, if somebody wrote something negative or said something, I would track them down. I'd get 1,000 great letters.  I wouldn't respond. But oh, that's nice. That's nice. That's nice. And one negative thing, I would track them down. I'd find them in Louisiana, Alabama, wherever you were. I'm going to-- and then call them up and say, excuse me. This is Oprah calling. They're like, what?  ARTHUR BROOKS: I know. It's like, oh, no. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: It's crazy. But you know, there's a lot of literature on this. Social scientists have looked at this a lot. If you're out for dinner with your friends having a great old times and there's one point of disagreement, that's what you remember from the whole night.  That's the thing that stays with you, right? That Thanksgiving dinner when, you know, Aunt Mabel, something-- you know, she went after, you know, her nephew, Jake because you know, they disagreed about President Trump or something like that. And that's when everybody's like, oh,  that was the Thanksgiving where Aunt Mabel went berserk about politics or something. That's what you remember about it. OPRAH WINFREY: We can't invite Aunt Mabel again. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah, because that thing happened. You had a great time for three hours or four hours. And it was, like, three minutes. But that negativity bias, man, that's like a blinking light.  OPRAH WINFREY: And we are-- so you're saying we're born that way? ARTHUR BROOKS: We're born that way. Absolutely, we're born that way. And sometimes it's great because it saves your life. But a lot of times, it just embitters beautiful things. And it's unrealistic. It's not even right. You know, the truth is a lot of times, we're feeling resentment because it's like,  can you believe the quality of this airline food? It's like, dude, you're getting all the way across the country in six hours on your middle class salary, and you're complaining about the fact that you don't like the food?  It's nuts. Or it's like, can you believe this? It's a little bit too cold on this plane or you know, whatever it happens to be that we say-- OPRAH WINFREY: That people just allow themselves to be absorbed by that? ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. I mean, we have these incredibly privileged lives. I get it, that we also have problems. And we have suffering. And not everything is perfect and all that.  But on balance in modern life, most of the time, it's pretty good. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: And this is the point that we can actually get to. And I've seen you do this a bunch of times. OPRAH WINFREY: Oh. The gratitude thing is huge for me. ARTHUR BROOKS: And I know it's been since you were a little kid, right? That you basically-- when you feel the resentment Welling up  inside you, when you feel the anger, even when you feel fear, that's when you start to reflect on the sources of-- OPRAH WINFREY: And not just reflect because it's not enough sometimes just to, like, think about it. I actually-- I have volumes of gratitude journals, volumes.  ARTHUR BROOKS: This is a really good thing because this is-- OPRAH WINFREY: Volumes of gratitude journals. And now I hear, like, everybody talking about it. And I see these reels where people are talking about gratitude. I've been doing it for years, and years, and years, and years, and years. ARTHUR BROOKS: And when you write it down, by the way,  it can't stay in your limbic system. Then it's in your prefrontal cortex. The act of writing something down and putting it into words puts it into the executive centers in your brain. And it sits there. I mean, it's in your memory banks at this point. You're really going to use it. And you have it in the most conscious  metacognitive way possible. This is the-- gratitude journals are great. Everybody should keep a gratitude journal. A failure journal is fantastic. We talk about it in the book and all kinds of ways that you can take your sources of disgust and discontent and turn them into learning and growth.  But the gratitude journal is a must for everybody. And there are a lot of ways to do it. You know, the easiest way is every Sunday night, write down five things you're grateful for. It doesn't matter how stupid they are. Like, my team one, right? I ate a Three Musketeers bars with my cousins, like you said, right?  Whatever it happens to be that delights your heart a little bit. And then Monday through Saturday, look at those things, and ponder them a little bit. Give maybe a word of thanks, maybe a little prayer. Sunday, update it. The data say that on average, after 10 weeks, you'll be 12% happier.  OPRAH WINFREY: I believe that. And I believe that in the moment, when you are feeling the worst, if you can just take a deep breath and go to the thing that, first of all grateful, for your breath and start you know actualizing for yourself--  and you're saying writing down is more important than just thinking about it, the things you're grateful for. You can feel your own vibration change. ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: For sure. Absolutely. OPRAH WINFREY: But for me, also, a walk in nature too. ARTHUR BROOKS: There's a lot of work on that that's really interesting. To begin with, that's almost a form  of worship for a lot of people. OPRAH WINFREY: It is for me. ARTHUR BROOKS: You and I have walked here. And it was sort of magic. I remember that we were working super hard on cooking up this book. We worked all day. We were really, really super tired. OPRAH WINFREY: And then we took a long walk. ARTHUR BROOKS: At twilight.  It was so beautiful, right? Because everything was so calm. OPRAH WINFREY: There's a picture is that. Yeah. Yeah. ARTHUR BROOKS: There is a picture of that. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. And it was-- somebody took a picture of us. It wasn't us. It wasn't staged. And it was-- I remember it was relaxed, and it was nice.  And some researchers are asking what it is about the experience of touching nature and that you can even get more if you're barefoot. That's a whole thing called grounding. OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've heard that. I've heard that. ARTHUR BROOKS: As a social scientist, I'm like--  but you know, it's funny. The data are actually quite compelling. OPRAH WINFREY: There's some truth to that? ARTHUR BROOKS: There appears to be that, you know, your feet on the grass and soil-- I mean, actually touching the grass and soil has a particularly profound impact physiologically on what we're experiencing.  OPRAH WINFREY: That's really interesting because I enjoy walking outside barefoot on the grass. But I thought it was because that's the way I was raised, you know? ARTHUR BROOKS: It takes you back to-- OPRAH WINFREY: Yeah, Mississippi. I thought it was like dirt road Mississippi. And you're just-- it's like a primal thing. I didn't know that it was-- ARTHUR BROOKS: Yeah.  No, there's work on that. And I do-- a lot of people-- a lot of us remember when we were kids that-- you know, out in the backyard, or you know, in the neighborhood and running around with our bare feet. It brings us back to those particular times. You can smell certain things from your childhood. But there is more to it than that.  Scientists believe that there is more to the experience of touching nature than that. A lot of times-- I wind up giving a lot of counsel and support to young people who are in their 20s. And they feel quite lost. And I get it. You know, they don't know the why of their life.  They haven't read our book yet, you know? And so one of the things that I'll tell them to do is to go on a process of discernment about their life to understand the meaning of life. And one of the best ways to do it, I recommend to everybody, but not just young people,  is to get up before dawn, it's hard for some people, and walk for an hour as the sun comes up. There's something profoundly mystical. It's cooler. It's quiet. You're alone with your thoughts, no devices, no podcasts,  except this one. Do that just with the sounds in your head, with the music of-- OPRAH WINFREY: I know somebody who does that every day. ARTHUR BROOKS: It's super important to do that. That's actually one of the ways that you can satisfy,  you know, the spiritual element of what a good and happy life actually needs, a transcendent life, one that transcends your day-to-day quotidian, ordinary, boring work existence. OPRAH WINFREY: Because you get to see how small  you are in compared to the largeness of everything else. ARTHUR BROOKS: I'm alive. I'm alive. I don't know what this day will bring. I don't know, and that's OK. I'm just really grateful to be alive this day  and to be walking on this road at this moment and to see the sun rising. It puts you in a state of awe. It puts you in a moment of peace. And if that becomes a-- and by the way, you get 10,000 steps. And that's a good thing to do too. OPRAH WINFREY: OK. So that's a good place to end, right?  That's all the happiness we can squeeze into our first episode. We've only just begun. Remember that song? (SINGING) We've only just begun. Who sang it? Carpenters. ARTHUR BROOKS: Thank you. I mean, it's like, I was a classical musician growing up. It's like, I was raised-- OPRAH WINFREY: You got to know Karen Carpenter.  ARTHUR BROOKS: I know, but I was like-- OPRAH WINFREY: Every freaking wedding for everything. ARTHUR BROOKS: I know. I know. Who knows? We played Bach at our wedding. OPRAH WINFREY: OK. So my gratitude to you and to all of our readers for their thoughtful questions, guys, we so appreciate that you're reading the book.  I just want to say this. I think this is a great gift idea for your loved ones. There's something in here for everybody. I am not just saying that. I think-- I, actually, today, sent three copies off to people that I know and I think will benefit from it.  So next up, episode two of our three-part \"Build the Life You Want\" series. And we'll be discussing chapters four and five, specific strategies for you to start taking action and building what matters to you. So thank you, Arthur. ARTHUR BROOKS: Thank you, Oprah.  OPRAH WINFREY: See you all next time. Thanks to our episode sponsor, The Hartford.

Just like people on YouTube spend way too much time on their hair I'm told they spend way too much time in there  If Nike owned opened a hotel I think we would be able to guess pretty accurately what it would be like If Hyatt came out with sneakers We'd have no clue  Because Hyatt doesn't have a brand they have a logo if I swap the signs on a hotel at that price point It couldn't tell if you were to marry it if you were a Hilton or the Hyatt the hallway the room  I don't know. Where am I no brand So what it means to have a brand is? You've made a promise to people they have expectations. It's a shorthand What should I expect the next time and if that is distinct?  You've earned something If it's not distinct, let's admit you make a commodity and you're trying to charge just a little bit extra for peace of mind The problem that Hyatt and Hilton and Mary it and the rest have his sort by price  Because if I go online now to find a hotel, it's really simple sort by price Why would I pay $200 extra to go a block away? I don't So what's the value of a brand the value of a brand is how much extra am I paying?  It's that time again, it feels like every year we Had a little you're like Santa Claus but with wisdom and insight Once a year you show up from like Jimmy and we have a conversation. I was looking forward to this  I'm not gonna ask you how you got this job this time because after Half a dozen times, I think I know the story, but I do want to know  About this book. I want to know I mean, I've always thought of you as the godfather of Marketing, you know if if Peter Drucker is you know old-school  Not outdated but just like, you know, he came before he's the previous generation. I always think of Seth as the new generation kiss the ring and so Help me understand this seems to me to be like the quintessential book on marketing  well, what's your take the thing is I don't do any consulting because I don't have the patience for it and What I love to do is find people I care about who are doing work that I'm proud of it gives them free advice  How can they achieve their goals? Bringing their work to people who need it and what happened was after the 50th time I heard myself saying the same things again  And again, I started this seminar the marketing seminar which lives online and it's not inexpensive, but it's really effective it's a hundred a seminar with  So far six thousand six hundred people have taken it and what happens inside it is I was watching people interact  With my lessons, but fifty lessons together and seeing how they interpreted them and watching them change and watching their work get better So it occurred to me, I don't know why I took so long. Oh, I know how to make books. Maybe I'll turn this  Into a book for people who don't necessarily want to commit the time To being part of a seminar and one thing led to another and the book became the book that it is now which is yes my version of  If advertising had never existed if David Ogilvy had never existed if the old model which was so magical Wasn't available because I don't think it is if I could teach marketing to someone what would I teach them?  So there's nothing it I think the word Twitter might appear once in the whole book is not about social media It is not about growth rating points or even conversion  it's about work that matters for people who care so break it down for me kind of what's What's the path? You know What is the method to the madness of laying out the chapters in the order that you did or? Does the order or not matter?  So the order we you have to begin by undoing the marketing of marketing you have to undo This idea that marketing is selfish. That marketing is a scam that marketing is this short-term interruption thing  So I spend a bunch of time on that. I wish I didn't have to but I do Because I'm saying to you you're a marketer and it's not an insult. It's a compliment because what marketers do is we make change happen Okay, which change for who?  so the first third of the book is what marketers do is we decide who we are seeking to change who's it for and What's it for and I'm amazed at how often people don't even consider this they think they're making average stuff for average people  And if they just yell at about it enough then their Kickstarter will hit 19 million dollars Well, yeah every once in a while I Kickstarter needs to do that But almost none of them do that the truly successful ones or the truly successful  Online stores are local bakeries or the person is trying to raise money for their charity are specific They're not general. So the first part and then I get to this idea that culture  Defeats everything if you've got culture at your back what you're doing is easy and you're trying to change the culture It's difficult. So what is culture culture is people like us do things like this? How do we break that into pieces?  Who are the people like us? What are the things like this? Then I do A turn into something that some people think is distracting but is in fact at the core of some of the big ideas here which are  Human beings make decisions based on status Not the status of I have a fancier car than you that's part of it But the status of who eats lunch first and the status of who's moving up and who is not moving up and what does that even mean to us that informs culture and  then I talk about Affiliation versus dominance because I see that more and more everywhere. I look Ok, so now that we've laid that out now we can get into some of the tactics the tactics of are you a brand marketer?  or a direct marketer because they're fundamentally different things and most people were brand marketers before the internet, but the internet Rings a bell and says if you're a direct marketer, this is here for you  and then I can we round hole circle and I end with a bit of a Rant about is the work. We do evil. Are we responsible for it? and if we are responsible for it, what are we doing here with this super powerful tool and  This tool we each have is more powerful than the assembly line was in 1925 Partly because we all have it if you have a keyboard You can touch the culture. What will you do with that keyboard what we do with that camera  Because we're not victims We're creators and I care very much about Helping people take responsibility for the change they seek to make and if it makes you a living, that's fine  It doesn't make you a living that's a choice, but don't do it because you're making a living making a living because you're doing it Yeah, well said, can we go back just a second and maybe? delineate or clarify  Brand marketing versus direct marketing. I think I know what you're saying to me. If I were to say it, I would say brand marketing or advertising Because to me one is a push Button, and the other one is a pull lever  You know brand marketing being a pull or it's pulling people in drawing them in with a tint, you know trying to build attention and Trust while advertising is more about Getting a return on the investment and getting someone to jump through a hoop, but maybe in your own words  Yeah, I I've that's legit, but I'd do it differently Yeah, because there are direct marketing ads and their brand ads. It's not the advertising that differentiates them. It's one simple thing you Can't measure a brand  You can measure direct you must measure direct right Lester Wunderman who was a friend of mine is a friend of mine The elder statesman invented the term direct marketing was on the board of Yoyodyne Direct Marketing is measured marketing  If you can measure it, you're gonna act differently because you can see what happened Tuesday and change what you do on Wednesday Brand marketing is a Cheetos commercial brand marketing is the Airbnb logo  They don't you can't test their Airbnb logo every day. It's the logo That's part of the way you tell the story of who you are. So a Lot of individuals who don't own the company  Like brand marketing cos can't get in trouble for a long time because no one knows if it's working and it's this magic Alchemy the Absolut Vodka ads in the back of the New Yorker for all those years. They didn't work. They didn't work They didn't work  They didn't work and then one day you're a genius right so know very few people make an Apple Superbowl commercial that changes everything Generally what happens is people show up  Put their brand in the world with or without an ad right Brad marketing is where did you put your store? Is it on the corner or in the middle of the block? You can't measure that because you can't open two stores one on the corner and one in the middle Direct Marketing though is the secret of Google and Facebook  Google gets all of its revenue 100% from people who are buying clicks that they measure and the reason they make so much money is they sell the clicks for a nickle and  If work they tell your competitors that they could buy it for six cents and so an auction takes place So you are making a little bit of money and Google's making a lot But you're still ok with it because it's better than making zero  so as we switch to this world of Direct Marketing we have to realize The metrics of brand marketing aren't appropriate and vice versa What does that mean?  It means if you're an individual and you're counting your facebook likes or your YouTube views you're making a big mistake Because you're doing direct marketing in that sense you're measuring it, but you're measuring the wrong thing and  That's gonna undermine your brand because we all know That the best way to get a lot of clicks is to act like a porn site and left to its own devices If it does nothing, but optimize sooner or later direct marketing on the internet  Races to the bottom because you're just trying to get a few clicks from a few people dumb enough to pay you something And my argument is we need to race to the top. So we need to use Direct Marketing when we should and  Brand marketing the rest of the time. Yeah. I think it's a really good point, you know when? Back-to-school timing hits and I hear those ads Start pinging. Hey, you know you can get jeans that are usually 40 bucks for five bucks just for this week of time  I'm being hit with direct marketing and that's ringing my bell the trouble with direct marketing or advertising like that is you know, it's can be expensive and sometimes it misses the mark and We're being trained to ignore it. Oh, yeah  Yeah, I mean Lillian Vernon l.l.bean the reason you've heard of them Lands End because every time they spent 50 cents on stamps They made a dollar 50 in profit  So they get it to infinity and that's the direct marketers dream get it right turn the dial But when we think about the marketing that makes our culture better  It might have a little direct marketing piece to it. But mostly it's a brand marketing exercise It also kind of reminds me of The Tortoise and the hare, right? Yeah Brand marketing is the tortoises race. The hares is direct marketing or advertising  That's right, you know it can be quick and you know You could spend five million dollars on a Superbowl ad and read everyone in one day You know, but how long do we remember that or how's that resonating? What's the risk? exactly  Can you weigh in on what seems to be the quintessential? Brand marketing play today as we talk about it the Nike play and Colin Kaepernick okay, so There are a few things that need to be understood about Nike  Biggest one you are not a key. I am NOT Nike. Nike is a bit of a special case Number two the vast majority of Nikes future and its present is overseas sales  So they're showing up and they're saying we're not Puma. We're not a ddos. We are Nike Well, you don't you can't say that by pointing to your sneakers because in a blind taste test the sneakers are all the same  Right, unless you're an elite elite athlete. It's about something else Well, Colin Kaepernick is a signal he's a symbol he stands for something and the other sneaker companies have been  Afraid to stand for what Colin Kaepernick stands for so is it risky? Feeling to go into a divisive area of politics that I don't think should be divisive but has become divisive Of course, it feels risky, but it was brilliant  It was brilliant because at the level Nike is playing now the number of ways that they can stand for something anything Is very small and here with just two words  They were able to say us him we stand for something when you talk about Nike you are standing You're talking about standing for something, right? And  The stock market has reflected that their market share has reflected that it's not easy for a brand to do something that singular What's interesting is if Seagram's had done it where?  Mattress firm had done it or some other advertise. It wouldn't worked because they didn't have the DNA To match it. It would have been stopped This wasn't a stunt that people who knew Nike said, of course, it was very natural for them to do that. Yeah, you're right  They've they've been seeding the market from the beginning, you know from youth sports although an eye and and they've also been you know the disrupter if you want to use that buzzy word in their industry trying to do stuff differently and  Shake-up. Yeah when you and I were kids sneakers cost eight dollars, right? So as a citizen I am thrilled that they've given this brave individual a platform to speak his mind as a marketer a brand marketer I look at that and say  If this is what the people at Nike truly believe is this is where they are going and it's a non Cynical act on their part. I have to applaud it because the kind of person that is decrying this  Psychographically Isn't their core audience. It's not what they look like. How old they are their income? it's what they believe and they tend to not be an early adopter of fashion that  Person, well Nike is selling to the early adopter of fashion by the time their shoes are at Payless They're not making any money at that end of the curve They make money at the front of the curve and the front of the curve the early adopters  There are people who are playing with new ideas in the culture They're not people who are trying to preserve old ideas in the culture Let's talk about what could could go wrong or could have gone wrong and maybe if we try this on another brand?  You know what can other brands learn from this particular case study, you know in the you know, we stand for this People like us do stuff like this. So let's talk about the anything a logo and a brand  Alright because companies spend way too much time on their logo. Just like people on YouTube spend way too much time on their hair I'm told they spend way too much time in there  If Nike owned opened a hotel I think we would be able to guess pretty accurately what it would be like If Hyatt came out with sneakers We'd have no clue  Because Hyatt doesn't have a brand they have a logo if I swap the signs on a hotel at that price point  It couldn't tell if you were to marry it to Hilton or the Hyatt the hallway the room. I don't know Where am I no brand? So what it means to have a brand is? You've made a promise to people they have  Expectations it's a shorthand. What should I expect the next time and if that is distinct? You've earned something If it's not distinct, let's admit you make a commodity and you're trying to charge just a little bit extra for peace of mind  The problem that Hyatt and Hilton and Mary it and the rest have his sort by price Because if I go online now to find a hotel, it's really simple sort by price  Why would I pay two hundred dollars extra to go a block away? I don't So what's the value of a brand the value of a brand is how much extra am I paying? above  the substitute and if I'm not paying extra, you don't have a brand so when we think about What brands ought to do to move forward the most important thing is to not worry about your slogan your spokesperson  They're wrapping. It's to worry about the substance work that matters for people who care find the people who care the smallest viable group you can live with And figure out how to give them work that matters  So if we compare if we're stung the hotel thing there are hotels these new chains of mini boutique hotels That charge double What a Hayat might charge for less  But it's only less by the Hyatt measure it's way more by the measure of someone who Cares about with the people in the lobby look like who cares about how hip it feels to walk into the bar  They're investing not in. Oh you get a room with three power outlets. They're investing in throwing a party in a place Where you also can sleep while you're on the road?  Those hotels have a brand and those hotels are some that some people pay extra for but almost no one in the scheme of things Yeah, can we talk a little bit about?  Demographic versus psychographic. Yeah, I love that. Yeah, okay, so they're only used to be demographics The only thing a marketer could pay attention What kind of car do you drive? How old are you? What's your income? You could buy all of those things for mailing this company?  But once the internet showed up particularly Google but mostly Facebook we could say This is for people who like that  This is for people who dream of that. This is for people who believe this. Those are psychographics It doesn't matter what your skin color is. It doesn't matter what your income is. It's what's your narrative inside?  So going forward the old-school marketer still talks about demographics They're wasting their time what we need to understand is in every zip code There are people of almost every psychographic perception  And what we have to do is brand marketers to say it's for you and it's not for you I didn't separate you because of who your parents were I Separated you because of what you believe and what you dream of if you want to switch what you dream and what you believe of  It might be for you. So I guy walk by the Supreme store. I see these people are idiots Good because it's not for me. It's for them. Perfect. I like that. I like that a lot. So  You know search engines and social media websites are collecting data on us whether we know it or not whether we like it or not but if so if I'm a marketer and I've got and I'm trying to build a brand then how do I  how do I find out who my audience is because I think sometimes We think it's one audience exactly. We might be completely missing the mark exactly. Okay, so let's start with the data collection thing Every time I go to Amazon  they rearrange the whole store for me and Every time I go to a regular bookstore, I am frustrated because they don't It but like what is what are the cat books? I don't like cats every time you know, I'm coming just take all the cat books out of the store  They don't do that for me Amazon does so when this is done properly People are happy it's being done because it's being done for them not to them when it's done improperly  It's when you get a phone call from your credit card company and they say we noticed you've been going to A lot of singles bars and strip clubs. Here's a coupon for free venereal disease testing  You don't want that phone call because you didn't ask for that engagement with them, right? So it's not about privacy It's about being surprised Okay. So now we go to serve some people  I'll begin by saying I don't think you have any business being a marketer Unless you have empathy for the people you are seeking to serve So what do I mean by empathy? I mean You don't know what I know. You don't want what I want. You don't believe what I believe  Here I made this it might be for you now the best way to begin as an amateur marketer is to Start with people who believe what you believe and want what you want great. Do you know who those people are? Can you imagine them start there?  You will find some people in that segment because you made it for you, right? So if you love to surf and to be on social media than inventing the hero camera Probably a good idea because you knew what it's like to be one of those people but  Sony should have invented to hear our camera and they didn't Because there wasn't a professional market around the scene who said I don't surf I don't want to be on social media but I could imagine what that would be like and So we begin with that we begin by asserting what a group  Who believes a thing might want to do how do you do that? Well, you can learn a lot by noticing you can learn a lot by thing. Why is there a line at the supreme store?  Why are people buying pokeballs right why are people doing this? Why are people doing that and those people? Who do that? They're also doing this which has nothing to do with that  but they're all doing it is because they're all doing it or because there's something those things have in common a feeling and So what our job is as marketers is to suss out that feeling make an assertion and then present it to those people  Not spend a lot of time in focus groups because people don't know what they want. They just know what they dream So is your recommendation then you know? Let's say I am  The GM right and and I'm looking just to create this product. Would you recommend then? seeking out someone who has expertise in that area and bringing them on the team is like a  Consultant or full-time hire or should we all just eat drink and breathe that subculture, you know for the next year and figure it out like You know when I was  Building Yoyodyne. We were hiring a lot of people So we took out a full-page ad in The New York Times Which was super fun to do and 500 people showed up and we interviewed them in groups It was really cool  And we sat around the table the groups of eight and the question I asked the group of eight is working together There was no Google that no smart phones working together Figure out how many gas stations there are in the United States?  And what would happen around that table? Every time two people would say I'll take notes two people would say Whatever anyone else suggested no, that's wrong. We don't know the answer  Two people would say not much of anything and then two people would lead this conversation It's really fascinating and you can guess who I hired But every once in a while Someone would say I don't know. I don't have a car  And that was really frustrating to me. It wasn't a question of how many guest agents. Have you seen in your life? it was  Figure out how to be wrong on the way to being right how to make this series of assertions about where to go. So  When you think about the people who built I don't know dropbox dropbox was built to solve a personal need That's great as far as it goes, but if you want to be a professional marketer  You got to do it again for somebody else's need And the way you do that is by gaining the empathy to imagine what it is to be in their shoes Don't have to be a woman to make pantyhose. You just have to be empathic  Let's shift gears and talk a little bit about mission driven companies. I mean, it's been a slow burn so TOMS shoes and Warby Parker and you know  These are some of the standout kind of cliche case studies. We talk about all the time But mission driven or Purpose Driven or maybe what you're saying work that matters? Maybe they're one in the same  how do we how do we get there and if we're not thinking about this should we and If we should then how should we reframe or re? Configure what we've already got going well, I  think the words matter so I mean I've known you for about almost ten years. Now, you are running a mission-driven organization. I know what your mission is and you have kept - your mission through thick and thin  That doesn't mean you are giving shoes to kids in Rwanda It means you seek to make change you are changing group of people who do work with leverage  You can visualize who those people are and the people who aren't those people you're not trying to change them you have a mission the medium could change you could stop using video and switch to podcasting, but your mission would be  Consistent and so I begin there which is too often. We get hung up by reverse engineering our mission We say I'm making money doing X, so I will come up with a phrase that will let me keep doing X That's not what you or I are talking about  When I think about someone like Blake at TOMS shoes Blake wanted to have a business that made money But also cared very much about the footprint that he was leaving behind. No pun intended with Tom's and  So then yes, they can make coffee and they can make sunglasses and they can make the other things that they've tried to make Because it's not about shoes It's how do I get an early adopter of fashionista? Who wants a story?  She can tell her friends to be able to buy a product. That's gonna have a better Positive impact on the world than the one she's currently buying That's the mission back to psychographic exactly and you know  So Warby Parker, they don't make a big deal of the fact that every time you pair by a pair of glasses They give one away. That's not why they want you to buy a pair of glasses what they've said is  For the kind of person who has better taste than they have a bank account right more desire to impress then they have cash how do we use the Delta between  What luxottica would charge for these glasses and what we would charge for these glasses to create? convenience and a vibe of fitting in alright because it's interesting if you couple things I could say about war be  Before war be open retail stores They didn't know a what a retail store would look like that would work for them and be where to put it So what they did was they bought a school bus and they outfitted the school bus like a store and  then they would go on social media and say the store will be here and they would park the bus in different places and Any place the bus did well, that's where they knew a store would do Well like a food truck right, but it was brewing because it wasn't a food truck just to be a food truck  it was intended to be a test of the store direct marketing thinking there a direct marketing company, but the other thing that's interesting is the cost to Warby to have 10 times as many glasses as they have would be zero to have every you know,  They don't sell these I'm glad because I'm the only one who has them, but they could sell these why don't they? because We'll be saying people like us wear glasses like these You don't have that many choices and so you can't screw up  There's only 20 or 30 looks to look to choose from that's exactly how many the slightly insecure fashion-forward glasses shopper wants to look at and Wore B's bet is that they can sell that person a new pair of glasses every three to six months  Whereas if it was looks odd, okay, you can't afford right. So again, the psychographic is what's baked in Warby isn't busy running ads of people who live in foreign lands who don't have glasses. That's not their story  That's not the story that resonates with the people they seek to serve Yeah, and if I can add to that, I think that they use a user experience company exactly So it's one of the smoothest user experiences I've ever had on the West super-convenient down respect  Yeah, and it's quick and and they have a Zappos Amazon like, you know customer service return policy. There's lots of things going for them That's awesome How about the the white space?  I like to talk about the white space, you know things that we're missing in marketing what our marketers missing I mean if you're a career marketer, you've done it all and You know, I've been on the client side. I you know, I worked for a big company  we had a big P&L and I did everything radio and TV and billboards and I took over the internet and spent gobs of money, but like  What what don't I know about right now that I'm missing well, I think the two biggest things are connected number one Your factor isn't worth much anymore It used to be worth everything so you had to defend the factory  You got to say this is what we know how to make so this is what we sell but now Everything's a click away so you can sell anything you want. So don't come at this as the customers wrong  I have this briefcase full of stuff. This is what I have to sell. It's how can I solve this person's problem? How can I market with them instead of at them and the second thing is attention used to be cheap. I  Think about it the phrase CPM Damn doesn't stand for a million. It stands for a thousand I'm not sure why cause per thousand we're buying people's lives a thousand at a time for pocket change and ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "What should other brands learn from this case study?", "Question 2": "Why do companies focus excessively on their logo?", "Question 3": "How is Hyatt different from Nike in branding?", "Question 4": "What does having a brand signify for companies?", "Question 5": "Why do brands struggle in price comparison online?", "Question 6": "What is the primary message in Seth's marketing book?", "Question 7": "How does the seminar relate to marketing strategies?", "Question 8": "What distinguishes brand marketing from direct marketing?", "Question 9": "Why are psychographics more relevant than demographics now?", "Question 10": "How can marketers better identify their target audience?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "Other brands should learn the importance of having a distinct brand and making a promise to their customers. They need to focus on what really matters to their target audience and create work that resonates with people who care. Brands should avoid getting bogged down by superficial elements like logos and instead concentrate on building substance and value that differentiates them from competitors. It's essential to understand and engage with the psychographics of their audience to effectively address their needs and beliefs.", "Answer 2": "Companies spend way too much time on their logo because, like people on YouTube spend too much time on their hair, they believe that a logo is the most important aspect of their brand. However, this focus on logos often detracts from what it truly means to have a brand, which is about making a promise to people and meeting their expectations.", "Answer 3": "Hyatt is described as having a logo but not a brand, meaning it lacks a distinct identity and promise to customers, while Nike is portrayed as having a strong brand identity that stands for specific values and resonates with consumers, allowing them to charge more and foster loyalty.", "Answer 4": "Having a brand signifies that a company has made a promise to people, creating expectations and a shorthand for what they can expect the next time. If a brand is distinct, it earns something valuable; if it's not distinct, the company may just be a commodity trying to charge a little extra for peace of mind.", "Answer 5": "The problem that Hyatt and Hilton and Marriott and the rest have is sort by price because if I go online now to find a hotel its really simple sort by price why would I pay two hundred dollars extra to go a block away I don\u2019t so whats the value of a brand the value of a brand is how much extra am I paying above the substitute and if I am not paying extra you don\u2019t have a brand.", "Answer 6": "The primary message in Seth's marketing book is that marketing should focus on making meaningful changes for specific audiences, rather than being perceived as selfish or a scam. It emphasizes understanding who your audience is, what they care about, and providing them with work that matters, rather than just measuring short-term results through direct marketing tactics.", "Answer 7": "The seminar relates to marketing strategies by providing lessons and insights for marketers, helping them understand what makes their work effective, and allowing them to learn from each other's interpretations and experiences.

In contrast, direct marketing is measured marketing where results can be tracked and evaluated immediately, focusing on short-term conversions and responses.", "Answer 9": "Psychographics are more relevant than demographics now because they focus on people's beliefs, desires, and narratives rather than just their age, income, or gender. This shift allows marketers to understand and connect with their audience on a deeper level by identifying what they dream of and care about, rather than relying on superficial characteristics that don't capture the essence of the consumers' motivations and behaviors.", "Answer 10": "Marketers can better identify their target audience by practicing empathy for the people they are seeking to serve.

You're all it's a homerun 100 thousand, that's it so the mindset of oh  I don't have to just show up arrogantly saying I insist I can show up and listen and assert and Everyone is not the goal cannot be the goal someone so  How is then that helped you with your marketing channels, you know You've got these products or services whether it's the LT MBA or the the marketing seminars that what we're calling it  Yes marque semenovka or your podcasts akimbo or your ongoing blog or new books? So I got super lucky because I decided I Didn't want more  I'm looking over your shoulder. And Tom Peters book is on you right over your shoulder And I talked to Tom he was my hero. I actually met him in 1983 when I was 23 years old and I Was on stage he was coming on After we were doing our tech check  I was holding my three-year-old because he had come down with me for the weekend and At the time tom was doing between 90 and 105 speeches a year. I  Have a picture of him sleeping on a park bench in Siberia to the Siberian Airport. I said Tom What how did you like what and he said I used to be able to do a great Tom Peters invitation  I can't do it anymore He said I had no choice. I have no choice. This is what I do. So it's like a shark it's like what he does and I looked at that and I said I don't want more I don't want what Tom's got. I don't want the biggest blog  I don't wanna have the number one best-selling book. I am NOT interested in whatever I would have to do to get more I Am happy with enough to do it for the people Who want me to do it with them because I made that decision  I was able to stumble on this idea of the smallest viable audience. So The all 10 be a which is one of the most successful program of its kind has had three thousand graduates That's all three thousand  So yes, it's many times bigger than Stanford Business School, but no, it's not three hundred thousand fine The marking seminar. My blog is read by I guess like a million people six thousand. I've taken the marketing seminar  Could I have goosed it to sixty thousand of course I could but that I wouldn't be me and so my posture has been Don't level up on staff don't level up on spend  Put all of it into better not more because if you can make better and afford to make better because you have true fans maybe they'll tell their friends and maybe you can do this work and doing this work is my privilege and  So I'm totally fine. If it's not for you great, please don't come I have there's no squeeze play There's no lowering the price for 12 hours metabolic why I don't need to do that don't want  Well, and that's how you've built your brand. So I guess the follow-up question to that is How can we use what should be our guiding principles, you know, is it our personal value system as a quality of life?  What can be the compass to know how to build our brand because you've you said you got lucky I mean, I don't know about that. I mean it seems Like it was pretty calculated and very strategic, but you went and I've gone down this path  And I'm sure there's been some twists and turns whatnot. But how can then the rest of us? Create the compass. What is our compass? Well, I think you got to tell yourself the truth and it's so like author so many authors have been to see me  I love authors. So what's your goal? I want to make change happen So do you care about being in the New York Times bestseller list? Well, yeah, I need to because then they'll help me make change ever really Really because I could tell you how to be on the New York Times bestseller list  but you have to trade this this and this for it and many of them do Because they're not actually keeping track of what got them started. They're using other people's metrics to do their work and  That's as bad as having a boss It's worse because now you're in this cycle so we know how to double your the number of Twitter users We know how to make sure that there's more of this or more that and you justify but you know  I have to make my editor happy and I have to do this and it no you don't What you need to do is get clear about who's it for and what's it for and if you are clear Like Howard Schultz was clear. He said I  Need America to drink better coffee Well, that's your mission Then yes, you need 19,000 Starbucks. Yes, you need to serve things throughout the day in the night  Yes, you have to be ok with you know still quest off because you can't figure out how you get the supply chain, right? That's all comes with I want all of America to drink better coffee But on the other hand, there's a guy who's got, you know, four coffee shops in New York City  He says I want to make better coffee period for people who want it He works with people he cares about his cashflow is positive he does the craft he wants to do and it's not someone else's agenda because he's not a public company and doesn't want to be  So both are available But be consistent and the mistake that happens is someone has four little coffee shops They say that that's what they want to do  But then they keep compromising so they can have 18 coffee shops that are now pretty sucky. I don't know why you did that well zooming out then I mean it sounds like and  I love this idea of business being so personal it sounds like to be The quintessential brand marketer, it really has to start right here has to start with us We have to be clear about what we really want. So Phil Knight is saying, you know, we want to be the company  the brand that stands up for People that is on the right set of history that does the right thing So I'm sure he knows profits and I'm sure he did some math  I'm sure it's not all altruistic. But those are the types of like value based decisions. We're making right the quality of life How much time we want to spend at home versus traveling a hundred days out of the year? Yeah, well  Whatever job you do whether you're a brand marketer or an accountant, I hope at some point you said what's in here? I don't think we need to be altruistic  But I think we need to be some true istic meaning we are true to some people for some people They can't believe how great this thing  We made is for some people they would cross the street to get it and if I go down the list of modern brands That is true all of them. So Procter & Gamble  Unilever brands not so much because they own shelf space and they own Acres of TV the TV's getting too expensive they could probably hold on in the shelf space for a while to come But that's not most of us  most of us are not seeing they're saying crystal like crystal like Crystal Light because the fact is there aren't that many people who are bound up in the story of Crystal Light But if you wanted to build an important new brand if you want to grow the brand  You've got you can't use the old technique because we know it doesn't work anymore And so what can you do to make a bigger impact which is you can be some twisted you can be obsessed with some people and Make them so happy to hear from you that  They open your email that they call you on the phone that they wait in line to see you at the booth that they tell Their friends and tell their friends and tell their friends that begins with someone Caring enough to have the grit to say we're gonna make good stuff not lousy stuff  So how is it being back and sort of traditional publishing? You know back to sort of blocking and tackling making books like you've done in the past. Yeah, so of course, I'm a hypocrite I have Repeatedly said it's my last book  I've repeatedly said the publishing industry is so crippled by the shift that I have to Respect the people in it, but politely decline but here I am back with my friends at penguin portfolio  The first reason is because as the seminar developed I realized I needed a book and I know how to publish my own books but when I thought about the mechanics of that I realized I needed a team of people who would do it justice and  These were the best people But I couldn't help myself. So the other thing that we did which we haven't announced at all Which is we're going to talk about after the book comes out is I actually made 19 extra covers for the book. Okay, and here's a couple of them  Can't show them to you in too much detail because it's sort of a secret but what we're going to do like my creative director and I did them all ourselves all  18 of these covers. So there's like an alternate cover like in a magazine like you write Sports Illustrated does exactly several different athletes Right same magazine different cover. So what's gonna happen is if you buy an 8 pack of the book from  800 CEO Reed who I'm working with. They're gonna put in the 8 pack Eight of these covers. You don't know which 8 you're gonna get collect and trade them kind of thing plus like 800 or $1000 worth of  free slots or discounted slot discounted slots in the videos from the seminar So you get all this juicy stuff for the cost of the 8 books and I got to tell you after the book was done  Yeah, because you could there's lead times and publishing. So now you like you have all this energy, but the books done so it was months of work to Make the envelope and the custom covers and the flip side of the posters and I loved that  I was just such joy because I'm only making 2,000 of them and I knew that only 2,000 people are gonna touch this but that made it even better because it was like  Okay, we get to roll up our sleeves and be craftsmen to celebrate this other thing we're doing So we didn't announce it in advance because we don't want people to just wait for it  But it's gonna come out right after the book launches. That's so cool. You are the master of creating scarcity You you love this idea, right? Yeah, I love it because it creates value yeah, it does, you know limited time or there's I'm only making 10 of these or  Yeah, it does right so part of it is Tension, which is what we know is before anyone says, yes, they get like this in any field you  have to as a marketer willingly dance with that tension because you're creating it right and Then on top of it scarcity creates value but what it does for me is the Creator is it lets me off the hook from infinity and  Infinity has never been my friend because if you are Making YouTube videos and you get a million Visits you say well, why didn't I get two million? Why didn't I get four million and what I get satisfaction out of the same  Sorry so that cuz now I know I couldn't have gotten any more cuz I don't have anymore. It makes me Emotionally more connected to the work than having to say, this is for everyone and I need six billion  Somehow that makes a lot of sense Can I get a little bit personal too and just ask you? You know, I know you always say when I ask you So what's next you know next is what I'm working on right now. This is what I'm most interested in You know  I've been there and I've done that that's fine. But like at some point Share a little bit of the Seth dream with us Like are you I mean we're out here sort of, you know, upstate, you know up up the traffic halfway to sing-sing prison. Yeah  is the goal to like retire in Italy at some point or like you're gonna have this, you know, Seth part two and you're gonna be some gourmet chef or create a chocolate factory like what are some of the What are some of the dreams and aspirations that you've got?  You know, I won the dream and aspiration Lottery a long time ago So if I wanted to live in Italy I could live in Italy and the internet makes it even easier I almost started top elite company. I was four days away from it when I  Tasted rogue chocolate I met Sean asked a nosy I said, I can't make chocolate better than rogue And I can't be a better person than Sean So all it would be as a marketing project and I'm already doing marketing project. Let these guys sell chocolate  Every once in a while I play with the idea of starting a significant entity a software company or something like that because I see The niches in the market but more and more I'll just call somebody up some CEO of the public companies they used to go through this so I don't have to  Have that conversation today, I hope that works, but the essence of it is this For someone who's lucky enough to be able to do almost anything. He wants this is what I want to do  I want to be a teacher. I want to be somebody who helps turn on lights and helps people not everybody some people see things that they can't unsee and It's always in the service. How do I make this place?  I'd rather live with my kids than it was yesterday Because if we could all figure out how to do that that positive cycle, I think that's what makes culture matter  So yeah tomorrow morning. I will wake up and I've done what I'm supposed to do for my publisher I'm off the hook, and I haven't written anything new and I'm not building a new course right now I've got the courses we run because they work and I want to run them again  And I've got the team of people in 40 countries who worked with me on various projects And I trust them and I love them and I want to do it again but It would be very hard for me to stop doing this right now I  Gave up. The airplanes has been Hard, but I've mostly done it now. I'm down to one a month But other than that everything else about what I do is a privilege our true privilege  You ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "Why is a talking bear mentioned in the text?", "Question 2": "What is the significance of true fans in business?", "Question 3": "How does the author define the smallest viable audience?", "Question 4": "What changes does the author suggest for marketing strategies?", "Question 5": "What advice does the author give to aspiring authors?", "Question 6": "How should one determine their brand's guiding principles?", "Question 7": "What does the author think about traditional publishing?", "Question 8": "What unique approach does the author take with book covers?", "Question 9": "How does scarcity affect perceived value in marketing?", "Question 10": "What are the author's dreams and aspirations for the future?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "A talking bear is mentioned as an example of something that is cheap and could be experimented with, suggesting a willingness to try unconventional ideas for marketing or branding without the fear of high costs.", "Answer 2": "True fans are significant in business because having a dedicated base of them allows for the creation of a sustainable business model where quality is prioritized over quantity.

I spent a lot of time this weekend reading your letter and my biggest takeaway from it was that you have a very clear sense of what's good for America, what's good for the economy,  and what's good for J.P. Morgan. What is the biggest threat in your mind to that confident vision? - So every year when I write that letter, I try to think of what are the most important things, and I would add to that  the free Western world, 'cause that's what worries me the most is that, you know the Ukraine War, the terrorist activities in Israel, you know the thread that that's drawing between Russia, Iran, North Korea, China, the difficulties of our age with China, that whole thing is challenging.  But you know, we would call the free Democratic Western world and that to me is the most important thing that we get all of that right. - Well, I wanna come back to the geopolitical backdrop in a minute, but right now I want to focus specifically on the economy. - Right? - As the chief exec of America's biggest bank,  you have an unrivaled insight into the financial health of the US consumer. What are people doing with their money right now? - So you have to look at a little bit of context. The consumer's in pretty good shape right now. Unemployment's under 4% has been there for two years.  They still have excess money from Covid. If you go back to looking at the amount of money that was spent during Covid, it was $6 trillion that basically went into consumer's pockets through various means and various programs, they're still spending it down. If you look at the bottom 50% of income,  they pretty much spent the excess. So the kind of back to where they were, the top 50% still is excess, housing prices are up, stock prices are up, jobs are plentiful, wages are fine going up at the low end, the consumer's in pretty good shape because of that businesses are in pretty good shape  too, because people spend, it creates profits. The one thing you gotta be cautious about, a lot of it's driven by just fiscal spending. - Mm-mm. - So even today, the deficit of 6% of GDP, you know, almost $2 trillion, that's driving a lot of this growth. And that will have other consequences possibly down the  road, you know, called inflation, which may not go away like people expect. So when I look at the range of possible outcomes, you know, you can have that soft landing, I'm a little more worried that it may not be so soft and inflation may not quite go away. People expect, I'm not talking about just this year,  I'm talking about 25 and 26. The rates may have to go up a little higher. I'm talking about the 10 year rate, the five year rate, and you know that we can have consequences, so we'll see. - But right now you describe a pretty rosy picture  and yet we know consumers aren't feeling it. Why this disconnect? - Yeah. Well you have to look at different consumers here. So the bottom 20% of America have not done particularly well over the last 20 years, incomes barely went up. They're actually starting to go for the first time in almost 20 years.  Remember suicide, fentanyl, crime, inflation, there are a lot of negative effects. Some people can't get, mortgages can't buy the home. Their jobs are still paying. You know, I think 25% of the jobs in America pay $15 an hour or less.  So yeah, there's part of society who's kind of struggling, there's part of society who's not and I think that's a different issue about how we deal with the policy. But you know, you can see why that has people upset. And then you see a whole bunch of other things that, you know, people look in the world, they're worried about geopolitics, they're worried about politics,  they're worry about polarization. So you have a disconnect about, about, you know, economy and as you said, confidence levels. - So just to go back to the soft landing in the letter you concede you were on the hawkish side, but then things played out in a more benign fashion.  But you are still, it's a slightly begrudging concession. You yourself sound quite glum in the letter. - Yeah. - Can you tell us a bit more about why that is? - Yeah, so I'm not looking at a year and I'm not making a forecast, I'm trying to say what are the range of possible outcomes? And last year and this year, I would put out the same issues.  Huge amount of fiscal deficit, huge amount of QE, we don't really fully know the consequences yet, part of it might be inflation. A lot of things in the future. Inflationary, the green economy militarization of the world, obviously the deficits, which you know,  basically aren't gonna go away as far as the eye can see. And so it puts me in this on the, and geopolitics all that puts me on the side of caution that things may not go as well as people expect. Again, that's not a 24 forecast, I'm cautious. So I think I said in my letter, the odds of a soft landing,  the market kind of prices in 70%, I think it's half of that. And so therefore the odds of something different, you know, is 65%, et cetera. And so, you know we'll see. But I don't really know, you know, as a business person, I try to be prepared for all of that, it's just a little cautious, it looks a little bit more  like the seventies to me. And I point out to a lot of people, things look pretty rosy in 1972, they were not rosy in 1973. So don't get lulled into a false sense of security, 'cause the today looks okay, that tomorrow's gonna be okay, so just trying to separate the two.  - Sticking with today then, is Bidenomics working - Partially? You know, when you spend that kind of money, you're gonna have growth. And you know, I think if you look at binomics you do have parts of it where we needed some of it, like some of the industrial policy,  I think the infrastructure thing is terrific, that was bipartisan. You know, other things will remain to be seen. So, and I think some of the American public looks at it like, what are they getting? - Mm-mm. So if you go to rural America or inner cities, I'm not sure they feel like they're being lifted up by this economy.  - Do you think Jerome Powell's doing a good job as chairman of the Fed? - I have tremendous respect for Jay, I think the Fed was probably late in raising rates. They caught up, they're probably wait, right? And watching right now, we don't know what's gonna happen,  you might as well wait. It's very hard to forecast the future, I've always told the Fed they should stop forecasting. I mean, obviously the data dependent, you know when someone makes a statement, you know we're data dependent. They say \"No matter what the data says we want it anyway.\" Well they can't, so they should wait and see.  But you know, they may have to get a little bit tougher and we also don't know the full effect of QE. Again, I'm a little more on the cautious side of that. You know, most people have a general feeling that you can reduce the balance sheet by several trillion dollars and its effect will not be felt.  I'm not so sure we've never had it before. So it's never really been tested. And the one time they started doing reversing QE at one point it did cause some ramification in the marketplace, I kind of expect that again. - So if we go back a year, J.P. Morgan helped out  with the mini banking crisis. Wasn't the first time you'd stepped in at a moment like this because in 2008 of course you bought Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. How did the experience, the 2008 experience help shape your approach to last year's banking crisis?  It didn't at all. I mean, that was, 08 was a real crisis, Bear Stearns was a much more complicated and so was WAMU within this one. This was much simpler, we thought it was the last domino because only a handful of banks had the same problems  of concentrated deposits, too much interest rate exposure, et cetera. And so I said it was the last domino provided rates don't go up and there's not a major recession, 'cause if that happens, obviously it'll affect banks again, so it was a completely different thing.  We wouldn't have done it if it didn't help stabilize the system, we would not have done it just for ourselves. I point out in the letter, 'cause people always look at just the financial side of that, but in reality, 10,000 people on day one who were working on future looking projects, went to do backward looking  projects to consolidate 165 systems, rules, procedures, et cetera. Though it was a simpler bank and part of the earnings was just using our own capital liquidity. I tell people, you don't have to buy a company, you know, and thousands of people when you can just buy  assets to do the same thing. So part of it had nothing to do with First Republic. So the financial results are nice, but we would try to be honest about where they come from. - So how's the integration going then with the platform? - Good, it's doing great. You know, it's obviously always hard and complex. Most, it would be done by the end of May,  so you might see some customer complaints because when you do the big complex consolidation systems, obviously certain things can go wrong and at a minimum some small things go wrong, so by the end of the year it'll be completely done. - Switching tack now to geopolitics,  we've got wars going on in the Middle East and in Europe that create an enormous amount of economic uncertainty, if we focus first on the Middle East. Do you think that the US position towards the Israel-Hamas war is the right one?  - I think Israel has the right to defend itself, I think war is a terrible thing. I think people have to be honest about what war is, you know, and when they look at these civilian deaths and all the things like that, so I don't know the specifics in the military.  I think the notion that they aren't gonna defend themselves is wrong. So I'll leave the military experts decide, you know, what's the right way to go do that? Every general I see on TV, and I've spoken to several, you know, city conflict is really bad. - Mm-mm. - And you know it's door by door, higher amount  of civilian casualties, you know Hamas must have known there was gonna be quite a reaction to what they did. By the way it's unjustifiable for any reason ever. so I wanna be clear about that. - And then we've got a war in Ukraine as well where,  you know, Ukraine clearly struggling against Russia. What would it mean for the global economy if Russia was to win? - It could be, again, I'm gonna put odds in this, it could be a potential disaster  because you know this is the first war in Europe, free democratic nation invaded by two or 300,000 Russian soldiers under the threat of nuclear blackmail. So, you know, we've never had nuclear blackmail before, which is also teaching the whole world. You know, maybe having a nuclear weapons pretty good thing  because people will be afraid of union. You can, you know abuse a neighbor if you feel like it, it would be on the border of NATO. You know, obviously NATO is re-arming right now, but the other thing is affecting all alliances.  So all military alliances, all global economic alliances. The nexus of Iran, North Korea, and China makes it very hard, in my view, for the Chinese American relationship because we're kind of on different sides of that. They say they're neutral, whether they're helping  or not, we are clearly not neutral. If Russia wins, I personally, you might see a lot of people deciding that, you know will America stand up for Europe? Can you rely on them? And if you can't rely on them, what are you gonna do?  And that includes economically, so that's why I kind of talk about the economic battlefield and the battlefield. So economically, every nation should say what makes me secure, what makes me secure in energy, food, and all the things I need. So I'm a little worried that if Russia wins that war,  you're gonna see kind of the world kind of enter a little bit of chaos as people realign alliances and economic relationships, et cetera. The tell thing is, is after World War II, the Bretton Woods, the Marshall Plan, the rebuild of NATO, WTO,  all these structures are put in place that actually led to a very safe, secure world, tax Americana lifted billions of people outta poverty and basically peace. There are a lot of small wars, but basically peace among all the major powers.  You know, if that's torn a sunder, who knows what it's gonna be replaced with. - Well, I thought that was a very interesting part of your letter where you're talking about the need for this new global architecture and it's the kind of big thinking that, you know we don't often hear from world leaders. Can you tell us a bit more about what  that architecture might look like? Give us an example of what you're talking about. - Yeah, so I'm not sure it has to be so new, just we have to go back and see what worked and what didn't work. But I look at the Western world, economic alliances should be kept together and we need to help the rest of the world.  So, you know Bob Gates writes in his book, \"A Symphony of Power\" that we've overused and maybe misused our military muscle. We've underused economic, intelligence, development, finance, diplomacy, all these other things.  So, you know we need American leadership. It should be done with our allies. It can't be done, you know our way or the highway, it can't be done. You know, America's known to, you know if it takes advantage of a situation, which we don't normally, but together,  trade development, finance, helping the nations, and then, you know, reforming these agencies, which clearly some don't work. And you can debate any which one you want, but, so you know to get trade right, we need to negotiate. I would reenter the TPP.  I think our government's gonna start talking about trade. I remind them we have trade with these nations. So when they say we can't talk trade, well you already have it. Why can't you talk about making it better? And of course, the TPP would be a geo strategic home run,  economically great, geo strategically great, our allies will love it and bring everyone closer together. And then you can also negotiate with China from a better position of strength. So you're not trying to keep it out of everything, you just wanna set it up in a way you think works for the free and democratic world  and it looks like a lot of these folks would like to destroy that and so we should do everything we can to stop that from happening. - So China's complicated, obviously, because on the one hand we have so much trade with China, the supply chains are integrated. But at the same time, we reported recently  that China is aiding the Russian War effort and there's now a proposal by the US to sanction Chinese banks. What do you think of that approach to China? How should the US approach China? - You know, I would tell America, take a deep breath. We have all the foodborne energy we need, the Atlantic  and the Pacific, no wars in North America, South America. The gifts of the founding follows the power of freedom, which I write about in there, which is extraordinary in terms of people, ideas, innovation, entrepreneurship, 80,000 per person GDP,  China imports 11 million barrels of oil a day. Their very complicated neighbor, their own actions are causing all their neighbors to re-arm, Philippines, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, India. Not because of America, that's their own actions,  they're scaring their neighbors. Their GDP per person is $15,000 versus our 80, you know, they have had good innovation, which, you know God bless them. And they rely on 11 million barrels of oil a day, I believe half which go through the Red Sea  or the Traits of Hormuz, which are guarded by American warships. So, you know we're in a very good position. We have to restructure trade around national security, kind of a no-brainer, like how we got there, who knows, don't like to cry, but spilled milk.  But anything that we need for rare earth for F35s, you know the ingredients for pharmaceuticals, semiconductor, you know important semiconductors and related where it might be used for military purposes, you could put AI in there and lithium and some other things.  Obviously we should resource friendly source or something like that. I would engage with China, I would have very tough conversation about what we're willing to do, what we're not willing to do. I would do it with our allies in mind. Not, you know, America our way or the highway type of thing.  So when we did the IRA act, I'm not against it, but it clearly was by America for America of America and it really irritated a lot of them. - Mm-mm. - And I don't want to tear us under the economic relationships either, so we should be very thoughtful, they need oil and gas.  So the L&G I think is very important to you strategically. So I would negotiate them around all of that and I'm glad they're doing it. So if you listen to Tony Blinken and Jake Sullivan, Janet Young, they're starting to engage and they should, and they should be quite clear what we need,  what we want, and we should listen to them. You know, they may have some legitimate issues and legitimate complaints and do it as best we can. As long as Ukraine is there and they're doing anything to aid a bet, I think it makes it very hard to have a great relationship with them.  And I think you know, that this thing in Ukraine is real. And you know, I don't know what exactly I saw some of these reports. I'm glad the government has the authority to do certain things if in fact some of these things are true. Yeah, they should do some sanctions.  - Right? - But they should expect some impact, by the way. - I want to turn now to domestic matters and the forthcoming election. We're in the very unusual position of knowing what a Trump presidency looks like, we know what a Biden presidency looks like.  Who's the best candidate for the economy for 2024? - Okay, I'm not gonna go into that kind of thing right now. And whoever is president, you know, we will try to help. I really would hope that whoever's president tries to reach out to the other side. You know, that Trump would put some  Democrats in his cabinet, maybe Biden would put some Republicans in the cabinet. I would like them to put a lot of experts around them. Not just academic, but you know practitioners in the real world, because I think it matters and to get policies right that are good for both America  and the world and that's what I would hope and so. - How about you as one of the experts? I know you are sure your name has come up in the context of a new Fed Chairman. - I would not do Fed Chairman, treasury secretary. I don't think I'd ever be picked for that, so. - You travel a lot, you talk to a lot of people  around the world. What are you hearing from the rest of the world about the forthcoming election? - Most of them understand how important it's for Pax Americana and how important Pax Americana is for them and how divisive it could be for them. They wanted to be mature, polite.  They want it to be all encompassing. They wanted to help the developing nations in the global South a little bit more, there's all of that, but they want American leadership. And America has a lot of allies. And if we reach our handout, a lot of people are gonna take that hand.  And you know, even the non-aligned want more of us, so that's what we should be doing and we should be doing it very intelligently. I think that battle line in Ukraine is America first. - Mm-mm. - That is the fight for democracy. I hope America's learned the world is not a safe place.  We need a very strong military that should be a (indistinct) non, and that if that doesn't go right there, that gonna get closer to all of our allies and we will have to defend them. And if we don't defend them, it will be on our shores one day.  So you know we've learned lessons, we learned 'em in 1941, we learned them in 1917, we will learn them again and so I hope we don't. - Still on the election, critics of Donald Trump, they don't just disagree with him, they think he's a threat to stability,  he's a threat even to democracy, what do you make of that? - I obviously hear all that stuff. We shouldn't ascribe to an individual about why they're voting for Donald Trump or Joe Biden. They're doing it for different reasons than a very simple thing.  Some do it 'cause they think the growth is better, regulations are better or America first or defender, they all different reasons. I think people should learn to listen more. Take a deep breath, try to, you know, think as a citizen and think about it's good for the long-term health of the country and that's what I hope people do.  - You listen, you go on your tours around rural America, what do you hear? I've asked you, what do you hear from the rest of the world? What do you hear when you go out and about in the US? - People are worried, you know, like you pointed out, the economy's pretty good, but they're still worried.  And like I said, there are legitimate reasons that their groups of people are angry. Now it doesn't mean their policies are right, it doesn't mean they're exactly right, but I think we should listen to 'em more. Now why are inner city schools failing? Why have incomes didn't go up for 20 years?  America grew at one, I think a little less than 2% for 20 years. I think that's anemic, I think we should be, why is that? You know, and why can't we do a better job for our veterans and veterans fans? Why can't we do a better job for kids that wherever  you graduate high school, if you graduate high school, even if you don't graduate, that you have skills that get you a job making $50,000 or more. They're all there, it all can be done. They can all be fixed and there's frustration in my letter, I had the letter from George McGovern about,  you know the bureaucracy. He realized he helped create through laws and regulations that in his own words that I passed for good intent, I didn't realize the unintended consequences, what it does for jobs and the ability to hire and the growth of a business and even litigation. He says it's, you know, frivolous and not everyone  who fell in front of my hotel was my fault. And how costly it's like we're demoralizing people. There are bureaucracy, our lack of collaboration, I think, you know, demonizing business. I mean, I think there's a lot we could do to fix it and so I'm hoping people do it.  - Like might you ever consider yourself to fix it? No, I don't think I'm a politician, so. - Okay, you're not a politician, but you are a chief executive and obviously there are a lot of pressures with the job. You had a near death experience about four years ago before. - Yeah.  - With your aortic tear and before that you'd had a big cancer scare. How did those experiences change you? - The cancer scare was cancer. - Yeah. - I don't know, I probably have a little PTSD from all of them.  And I think it's hard to say, but you obviously, I'm gonna use a word, but I got it from another lay of reporter, Julia Baird I read it, something she wrote in Australia about  you try to live life a little more deliberately. So nothing, it's not like I'm wanted, I love what I do. I love my job, I love my family, I love all those things. So nothing really changed that way, but it is a little more deliberate, you know and what's better for the world and you know, more things like that, but those things  do change a little bit. And I still go into denial, like, and then someone reminds me, I say, oh yeah, I did go through that stuff. So when I was being wheeled in the operating room for the dissection, I knew it was like 50/50 and I didn't have any regrets.  So you know, 'cause people always said, do you have regrets? I said, no, I love my family and fortunately they were all there. But no, the only thing I would say, I do wanna help this country and the world and the free Western world that is on my mind, maybe that changed a little bit.  - Yeah, I mean another traumatic moment that you lived through was the 2008 banking crisis for different reasons obviously, but what lessons did you learn about leadership when you were taking J.P. Morgan through that turmoil? - Yeah, so people ask me, what did you learn?  I didn't really learn about leadership then first of all, it's like you have to go to war with the army you have people say, \"What did you do differently?\" So I always believed, I always looked at the world like ranges of outcomes I was always kind of prepared for. And you know, of course I grew up on Wall Street  and I saw a lot of crises and we had bankruptcies and we had companies go bankrupt and scares and panics and the market fell, was it 25% in one day in 1987? So I was kind of used to that. And so the risk committee used to meet once a week,  met five times a day. And instead of it being a little bit more of a structured meeting, it was unstructured. I'd say, Emma, you got a problem. You bring whoever you got, just don't wait, bring 'em up, have 'em wait outside. And they would meet at 5:00 AM, 10:00 AM you know, Asia time  and any time call people in the middle of the night, people work seven days a week, client by client. Remember we have thousands of clients through this crisis, even before Bear Stearns and WAMU and including governance by the way.  So the lesson is be prepared beforehand and have a functioning, you know, risk committees and stuff that all they do is just do more of it. And I remember flying home from Saudi Arabia, city stock was collapsing, I canceled my trip.  I got back just to, I just to be there. I basically spent the next three days, twirling my thumb, right? But I had to be there. - Yeah. - And so just being prepared and being ready and also reacting quickly, getting the right people in the room, having the right conversations, taking quick decisions. - And now, I mean there a new,  I wouldn't call it a crisis, but there's a new challenge facing banking and that's in the shape of AI. How do you think that's gonna influence your business? - I think there's a lot, so I think AI is a real thing. So, you know, and I don't know what's gonna grow like this. We're kind of straight line and I think people waste  too much time guessing in that we have 2000 people redoing it. We have a hundred and people or so involved just in research on AI, synthetic data, you know looking at data. And also we put AI and data together because they're directly related. We now have someone at the management table,  a very capable woman who is responsible for both. And then inside each business we have mirror groups, you know, AI and data people and trading credit cards, consumer, asset management, et cetera. We run 400 use cases already, we're testing LLMs  on our own data. We're testing LMS on our data, plus outside data. It's used for risk, fraud, marketing, idea generation, handling of errors. We're building agents which actually make decisions. So, you know, you might have a customer complaint,  we know what it is, it'll actually decide to send you a new debit card that doesn't go through any person, we know what happened and so it's real and you, we should learn it. And to me it's just and also every time we meet as a management team, every business, what are you doing? Yeah, what are you doing? So the the other trick isn't the technology's  getting people saying, how can I use it? And once they start using it, they realize the power of it and it will be exceptional. It'll create jobs, it'll eliminate some jobs, it'll make everyone more productive, it'll be used by bad guys.  So we already do things like, we recognize your voice, we know who you are and you enter our systems. We actually identify you multiple other ways. Bad guys can take one second of your voice and replicate it and fool our voice recognition system, so we have to make ours better to capture that too.  We don't use voice just so your readers know to move money. It's just one of many things we use to make sure you're the person you say you are and so it's a big deal. It will change a lot of things. I think for health, I think it'll cure cancer. I mean I've already seen things where it's designed  new molecules to hit specific cancer cells in a way the human brain couldn't come up with, you know, it's reading radiology, I think I'm told better than a radiologist can read it now. It'll take data from your blood from the last 30 years,  your RNA, your DNA which in your blood system, it knows if you had measles and mumps and all these things to actually figure out what you might have next and so it's gonna change the world. Your kids kids will probably live to a hundred, never have cancer, you know?  So, and that's a great thing. Technology the other thing has always done this, it's always done great things for mankind with some downside planes crash, drugs are misused. - Yeah. - You know, for steam engines and fire burnt down buildings, you know, and then we fed fire engines and so it's gonna be used  and it's gonna be kind of exceptional, have you used it yet? - Yes, yes. With mixed results, but like you it's sloppy. - It's still not good, you can. - Yeah, but if you all go to Bing or something like that, you can have it summarize a book,  make up a thing, have idea generation for you and so think of JP Morgan. We have huge amounts of data that other people don't have that we can use to do a better job for you. Marketing systems, ops, safety, security, idea generation, et cetera. So we announced something called Chase Media,  which is effectively that you get to come in, you know, the Wall Street Journal can come in and say, we want to contact these kind, you won't know the names, we won't give you the data. These kinds of people to make this kind of offer. - Mm-mm. - And you know, at one point we'll be doing more of that. - So this is the absolute latest, the most cutting edge  of digital technology that you're talking about, how the world's gonna change. But at the same time, you are busy building out something very old fashioned branches, physical bricks and mortar branches in hard to reach communities, what's that all about?  - Yeah, so since I got to (indistinct) in 2000 and J.P. Morgan in 2004, it was like, it was clicks, not bricks. - Yeah. - People were closing that were making a million dollar a year profit. Remember the goal in life isn't to satisfy us because we're guessing about the future. The goal in life is to satisfy you,  'cause you're the customer who uses our products and services. And so we still have almost a million people a day who go to branches, you know, in spite of digital account opening, you know, of 60% or I've got the exact number still are open in the branch. People like to visit their money. The branches are much more advice today.  So I'll tell you about one that I'm opening in Bronx soon. So in that branch in the old days had 12 people, it was mostly operations, mean checks, cashing money, taking deposits. But now it's advice, small business advice,  investment advice, mortgage advice, budgeting advice and it's eight or nine people. So it's morphed into something different, but it's still valuable to the consumer. And also remember when we build a branch, we also end up  with private banking business and small businesses, we help the local community. They like that, you know, so it, it's got benefit. And so the community branch roping, we have 16 of them. They're bigger, we hire locally, so in the Bronx.  So it's a local community. When we have food or art, it's done locally. The building of the branch, the renovation is done by local people. And then we hold financial education classes to teach moms and dads and kids about saving money, gain a mortgage during a business  and they've been great and the communities love them. You know, I'm doing local press, so I'll be doing like the Amsterdam news, the Harlem News and wherever you go, they're very local press that, you know, gets the word out and they've been great. And then we started the community manager, so every branch had a branch manager.  These branches had a community manager whose job isn't to run the branch, but to go to the local businesses and little leagues and not-for-profits and churches and synagogues and invite people in and it's been fabulous. So we now have 150 community branches around the country.  Community managers who outreach in the community and you know, and generating business. - What do you ask the managers when you go to visit them? - Who's walking in, what's working, what's not working? What's slowing you down? I always love to ask, what's the bureaucrat  stupid stuff we do? Just lay it on me because every business does, and even if you weren't yesterday, you probably invented a new one today. And then we change it, you know, like what works, what would you do if you ran the branch and what would you do differently? You know, sometimes you get ideas like,  well I changed the hours, you know, we're running it, you know, nine to five, I'd run it, you know, from eight to 10, you know, whatever. So we learn, we always learn. It's amazing when you go, the work we did in Detroit spawned advancing black pathways, has spawn work skills initiatives, has spawned the Detroit Service Corps,  it's spawn virtual call centers, because of what we did in Detroit. So now we're doing that in cities around the world. And so you learn a lot when you get out in the road. - Now you've been chief exec for 18 years and you're obviously in a very powerful position. But even the most powerful people,  powerful leaders need checks and balances, who keeps you in check? - Well, my wife would probably say I do and she does. But I think my management team, we're all very open, everyone we share everything.  I emote to them, you know, ways that you wouldn't hear me do it elsewhere. They emote back, you know, you're wrong. You didn't read it properly, you missed this major point, so it's a very open conversation.

So you try to create a very open environment. And then also, you know, we have regulators, auditors, press. So we get, believe me, we get a lot of feedback from a lot of people even in the press I always tell people when sometimes it's wrong and we have a knee jerk reaction, I always start by saying, are they partially right?  Like dividing into component pieces, you know, so maybe there's something there that we should fix, even though we think the story was too skewed. Separate the two, don't just have a knee jerk reaction to every complaint you get. - Just to bring it back to what's going on now, the current news cycle with these very polarizing issues  in America. Do you think that's the sort of thing that chief execs like you should comment on publicly or make statements as a company on. - The answer is yes. If it's appropriate and you know how to do it. So, you know, in my letter it's quite clear I'm a like a  full throated red-blooded, patriotic, free enterprise capitalist and I'm unabashed and unashamed. I also acknowledge that we've left part of society behind. There's nothing wrong with acknowledging it and trying to do something about it. So, you know, we do a little bit of both.  And so I think it's very hard where people make a mistake sometimes is when you look at certain laws and they're passing legislation and people are pounding up saying you gotta support this. But if you read and which we read it, so when some of these laws got, we read all 50 things in it, you and I would agree with some and we wouldn't agree  with the others. So we're being asked to make a binary decision. I said, no, we're not doing that. So we'll support the LGBT community. We'll support free, fair, safe voting. I don't have to get involved in every little voting act that every state's put in place because you know, some are tougher than others,  but most of 'em generally, you know, are free, fair and safe and so you gotta be a little careful. But when it comes to defending our people, absolutely we're gonna do it. - Mm-mm. - When it comes to lifting up other parts of society, absolutely. We think lifting up, you know, parts of community, I remind people J.P. Morgan reaches out,  we're in a hundred countries, we reach out to 12,000 businesses, 80 million Americans, cities, schools, states, hospitals, the military. We hire vets, we hire disabled, we hire, we also reach out to disadvantaged communities. And I mentioned that community branch and they work  and they generate business and they help lift up society. You know, if you can take, I always say, and I we use Detroit as example. If Detroit was a failing city and is no longer a failing city, that's good for the rest of America and it's good for Detroit,  we happen to be the biggest bank in Detroit, so it's obviously good for us generally. And so, you know, we work on it. We also work I always think is important for business people is, it's one thing for me to, we do skills initiatives in New York, you know, the CEO jobs council in New York trying to get, you know,  and we've helped hire, you know, 30, 40,000 kids outta CUNY and we're doing programs with the mayor and the Department of Education chancellor in the high schools now, all started by my wife by the way. But we also, and I think it's important that business  get involved in public policy. We can do all that we want, but if we can make the public education system better, the VA system better, the FA system better, the highway safer, the bridge is safer, that's good for everybody and so I do think business should get involved in public  policy as appropriate. - So you're often asked, when are you going to retire? And your answer is often in five years. - Yeah. - So is 2029 the year? - No, I stopped saying that. So first of all, it's totally up to the board, we've got wonderful people.  We've always said, I'm one of the few people who has a president in place who could take over tomorrow. And not many people could say that. And if you spoke to the people who know the company, they would say they're four or five people, they would be very comfortable with running the company. You know, they're being moved around at different jobs.  They're very good, they're very happy, I'm very happy the board will decide. I think I would tell you when I can no longer give my best, am I all, I shouldn't do it, I should move on at that point. But you know, I still have the energy and the capability and I still think I'm aging well in terms of,  you do gain wisdom as you get older. And hopefully you can provide value to the company and my country through this perch. - So I've got some final questions here, they're short questions that require short answers. - Oh, okay. - How many days should people be in the office? - Five is ideal.  There are some jobs where, you know, taking a day or two at home is fine, it is very job specific. - Are Americas downtowns dead? - No, I think some are gonna have difficulty, 'cause their own policies, but no. - If you're a young person and you want to work  at J.P. Morgan, what should you study at college? - It almost doesn't matter to tell you the truth, 'cause you're looking for smart, ethical, decent people. You know, if you took history or not. But I do think in business you should learn the language, your business, which is accounting and learn a little bit basic business. So I think it would help to do accounting,  finance markets, something like that. - On the rare occasion that you take a day off, what do you do? - So my daughters have said to me, \"Dad, you need some more hobbies.\" I love my family, so we have a lot of family dinners when I'm around. We have mostly Sunday night, maybe Saturday night,  but I told 'em, here's my hobbies. And we do a lot of this together, we hike together, we take vacations together. I love wine, I love music, I love history. Actually I try to exercise every day. You know, I just started playing squash again, which I'm still worried about, but I'm gonna do it,  but I was doing my 10-year-old granddaughter, so. - So you say you love music, any particular type of music? - Almost all. - All. - Yeah. - Eclectic - Rock, Jazz. Jazz is the only one I don't, but I don't, I just don't, it doesn't resonate for some reason. But you know, I grew up with classical,  I grew up playing classical piano, I can play the guitar a little bit. I'm gonna pick that up again soon too, by the way. So I love Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Rolling Stones, Beatles, you name it. - What's your morning routine? - Okay, I wake up usually at 4:35.  I read five papers, you'll be happy to hear in a very specific form. So I flick through the post, 'cause everyone else does it. I read the front page of the Washington Post, any story that I find very interesting and the business section, which is very narrow and the editorials, I think there's some very smart people  at the editorials there that then I read the New York Times front section, beginning to end all of it, whether I like what they're saying or not, I read their business section, which isn't great. Then I read the Wall Street Journal front Section Exchange next and then the FT and the reason I do FT last is  because all the other ones are very much skewed to the US and you know, we operate in a hundred countries. So the FT gives you a better view, like the Economist, I read The Economist every weekend of what's going on in Pakistan and India and the UK  and the Middle East and China and the Economist is unbelievably well done, FT covers all that ground too. So I love it if you know it takes me an hour. Then I do a lot of other reading, by the way, both internal mail, Axios, you know,  Politico, stuff like that. So I like reading, I'll do it for hours in the morning, but then I like to get a little exercise and go into the office, so. - And do you ever switch off your phone? - I am not a fanatic on the phone. I don't even have it here, I have it outside,  but I think people should spend a little less time in that, a little more time thinking, I haven't done podcasts. When my exercise, I'm either doing music or watching some stupid show or something like that.  So, but I'm not a fan, I'm not on any social media. Every year I test it, I go on for literally just a week to see what everyone else is doing. You know, reels and Instagram and Facebook and TikTok and then I click out of it.  - Never attempted. - No. - Good. Well, Jamie Dimon, thank you very much indeed, - Emma, it was a pleasure, thank you.

Not just like a giant list of stuff you have to do, but it's like I need to finish these things and you prioritize. Anything that you want to do but you can't fit into that sprint you put into your backlog.  And you have this giant backlog that eventually has to get done. But you prioritize every sprint, what has to be done. And there's points and assigned because that's how you know how much you could do.  Because you say this one is kind of like three points because it you know this is how complex it is. You compare it to other tasks that you've done. This one's ten. This one was really complicated it's 21. It was that Liberace? Who is the Pumagachi? Charlie: The Fibonacci sequence.  Stan: Fibonacci, Yeah. You use 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, whatever, you keep going. You assign points to that. And if a number becomes too big like over 21, you break it up it's a smaller numbers, small task.  Anyway, that's too hard. I'm going to stop now. Marshall: You described it very badly but it sounds great. Stan: Oh, god. Marshall: It sounds great. I want to know more about it.  Stan: If you are part of a team that is unorganized and there's so much to get done that everybody is confused and you need some kind of order read the scrum book. You'll love it. It will help you in your team.  Marshall: Okay. So, I'm going to see if I can outdo you for our reporting our thing for making it lack even value. [laughter] Charlie: Wow!  That is harsh Marshall. Stan: I am proud of you. Marshall: Why? Stan: Because you're finally being mean. Marshall: Oh, yeah. Yeah. It just cropped up out of me that it just took like four minutes to not get what scrum was.  [laughter] Stan: Okay. It really takes me messing up a lot for you to be mean, right? So, that's what you're saying. Marshall: Yeah, you've earned it. Stan: [chuckle] Okay. Go ahead, what is your thing?  Marshall: This is an abstract idea but it's this, when you asked me what my thing was several episodes ago I said it was Ken Burns the West. And I had only seen that documentary once. Stan: Okay.  Marshall: Well, since then I've watched the entire thing again. It was even better the second time. Stan: Are you really reusing your thing? Marshall: No, I'm not going to reuse it. It's I am going for an abstract concept.  If you ask me a few months from now, I'm going to say I watched Ken Burns the West again. And this will go on for years. And I've realized that this really is my thing. It's the kind of thing other people don't do.  When I was a kid my parents told me that I used to sit in front of the record player and play a record over and over and over and over countless times and over years too. I still do this. I watch movies.  There are a number of movies that I've seen about 30 times partly because I watched them with students and show them every semester in a class. But sometimes, it's just because it's interesting to go back over them that many times because  some things yield the more you go out there. I read books multiple times over and over also. So, that's my thing. Stan: You are cheating. Marshall: Why?  Stan: And now your insult really doesn't have any ground to stand on. Marshall: How did I cheat? Stan: You reuse the thing. Marshall: No. I didn't. Ken Burns the West was not my thing here.  My thing is that I watch things over and over and over and over. Stan: That's skanch. All right, whatever. I'm just kidding. I do like that idea. In fact, I was thinking about that my son was watching Teletubbies and I was watching  it with him. And they repeat the same clip over and over again. In the same episode they play like the same like three minute clip like five times. I was like wait, why are they cheating? They can't do that.  They literally just made like a five minute episode and drag it on for 30 minutes just because the kid won't notice. I think Melissa was like, \"No. That's the thing.\" Like, \"Kids need repetition.\" Marshall: Yeah. Stan: And I was like, \"Okay, cool.\"  Marshall: Well, I feel like one of the tests of a movie, one of the tests of a book, is is it worth multiple readings? And if it is if something's worth reading three, four, five, six, seven, times there's got to be something in there that this is this is rich it yields.  Stan: I think but for kids though, there's something about actually seeing the same thing multiple times that there's other value in it. I don't know. Just the concept of repetition in itself is a thing. Marshall: Well, I feel like we've sort of -  Stan: We're done. Marshall: Let this balloon deflate to where now it just sits there as a sad wrinkly thing. Stan: Are you describing yourself? Marshall: I don't know how to end now. What do we do? Stan: We're done. Marshall: Okay. Stan: Yeah.  Marshall: Good. Stan: Five star review on iTunes, that's a must. If you haven't done that yet, you are bad at instructions. Marshall: But that would be your thing. Five stars whether they deserve it or not. Stan: Oh, yeah.  Five star review not just a rating.They have to say something worth five stars. Like this is the best podcast ever. I've replaced all my other podcasts with this one. Marshall: It helps you feel superior. Charlie: Repetition of this podcast.  Stan: Oh, yes. Listen to it multiple times. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: Cool and what's the comment for YouTube? Which is your favorite and habit for success that we went over? Marshall: Oh, I've got an idea for this.  Stan: You have a change of mind? Marshall: Yes. Change yours. Take these 23 and this means that will get past the flippin com- I mean, I'm not going to pay attention to flipping comments. I want the ones that people are going to put some energy into this.  How would you take these 23 and group them into five or fewer? Stan: Oh, Jesus, you want them to do my job. Marshall: Yeah, yeah. Stan: Thank you Marshall. I like this idea. Marshall: How would you revise this to get it down to the simplest thing possible because it's easy to keep adding things onto it?  It's hard to see if you can get that list down to something smaller. Okay. Yes, sorry. Stan: All right. Thanks guys. Will see you next week. Go ahead and do my job and help me figure out how to break up these habits in the next couple episodes Bye.  Marshall: Sorry.

Stan: Are you rolling? Charlie: Yeah, we are rolling. Marshall: We are rolling. Stan: Oh, snap it's Marshall Marshall: Hi? Stan: We're back for the Draftsmen podcast. Marshall: Let's do a podcast. Stan: That's what I just said. Marshall: Oh, well. I was just kinda assuring we are on.  Stan: Are we going for the awkward intros every time? Marshall: No, because eventually they'll become so normal that they'll be comfortable and people will see through the false awkwardness and know that they're really at ease. Charlie: People are clamoring for the singing intros. Stan: Oh, yes.  Marshall: Oh, yeah, yeah, well, I'm not prepared, sorry. Stan: You're always prepared to sing. Marshall: Awkward.  [music intro] Stan: Alright, guys. Welcome to the Draftsmen show.  Today we're going to talk about, Habits for Success. Marshall: \"Habits for success\". Stan: As an artist. But they're probably good habits for anybody. Marshall: Yeah. But we've given a more thought about how artists succeed and don't. So, this is specifically. Stan: Yeah.  [laughter] Nice. Marshall: I like that sound. It's a little rat for those who can't see. Stan: I thought you were drinking. You know, like finishing your coffee. It's like [slurp sound]. Marshall: The slurp sound. Stan: Sounded like a slurp. Marshall: When you slurp you know you're comfortable.  You know you're in the presence of someone with whom you can be a slurper. Charlie: You slurp in Japan, it's a sign of respect. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: It means you are enjoying. Marshall: Slurping I think is a good thing. I didn't know that in Japan you slurp out of respect. Charlie: It shows that you really appreciate the meal. Stan: And belching too, right?  Charlie: That I haven't heard. Stan: I heard that just showing anyway that you're enjoying the food is respectful. Charlie: That could be, yeah. Stan: Like if you're sweating and slurping and burping, it's like; Wow, that guy is really into that food.  Marshall: It's yeah. It's also, there's a kind of family togetherness with it. This is us. Habits for success. Stan: There was one dinner I was having and I think the dad just farted and it was totally cool. And my mom and I looked at each other like, what the hell?  [chuckle] I guess that's cool too. Marshall: Sure. If you're in a family. Stan: Yeah. But we were over. Marshall: Yeah. Okay, yeah. Stan: I was young so I don't remember the - Marshall: That means you're part of the family. Stan: I guess, yeah. Marshall: Yeah, we are comfortable around you. Stan: Yeah, yeah. Cool. Marshall: What do you want to talk about, Stan?  The Habits of success? Stan: The Habits of Success. I'm working on an episode. And it started as an episode that was called Five Habits for Success. And me and April, the writer that you recommended to me, again. Marshall: April Erickson.  Stan: Yes. We had several Skype sessions and eventually, we came up with like 22 habits for success. Marshall: That's a lot. Stan: And so, now we are like, wow, great! Okay, that's like a two-hour episode.  So, we haven't split them up yet into several episodes. But, I think at this stage, it would be nice to talk to you about them. Marshall: Okay. Stan: So, that's how this episode came up. Marshall: I'm worried. Stan: Should I read them? Marshall: Yeah. How many are there now, 20? Stan: I think there's 22.  Marshall: Anything that adds up to 22, I worry about though. There was a- Stan: 23. Marshall: 23. Yeah, yeah. Stan: So, is that a better number for you? Marshall: Yeah. Of course, when you've got that many, my inclination is going to be to clump these together into groups, which I assume you've already done.  Stan: That's what I'm trying to do because if we can clump them into groups then we can make them into separate episodes. Marshall: Got it, okay. Stan: But I haven't clumped them into groups yet. Marshall: Well, in the interest of time and because when people are listening they say, \"I don't know if I want to sit through 23.\" Why don't you read them rapidly? Stan: Yes. I'm just going to read them all.  Marshall: Okay. Stan: And then we can choose a few because there's no way we can talk about all of them. Okay, number one; draw from life. Yeah. Number two; draw in your head. Number three; become your own best critic.  Four; get information from multiple sources. That's one that we don't have too much information on. We might actually cut that one out. You don't want to cut that one out? Or do you like that? Marshall: No. Just keep going. Stan: Okay, cool. Marshall: We'll discuss it. Stan: Five, train like an athlete.  Six, break big things into smaller things. Seven, protect your most creative time. Eight, go beyond the minimum requirements. Nine, think like a kid. Ten, research, research, research.  Some of these, I don't remember - Marshall: Just kind of like thinking like a grown-up. Stan: What? Oh! Think like kid, think like a grown-up? Marshall: Yeah. Stan: Yeah. Actually, some of these, I don't remember exactly what we were going to say about them based on just the name of the habit. Marshall: Think like a kid has to be developed.  Otherwise, it's like think like a kid, think like a grown-up, what's that mean? Yeah. Stan: Yeah. Patience, it's 11. 12, draw things you enjoy. 13, remix your inspiration. That's one I don't remember, what that means.  Marshall: No. I like that. That's the art parents thing. Stan: Mmh, you're probably right. 14, share what you learn. I think that means teach. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: Number 15, spend time with other artists.  16, say, no. 17, say, yes. Marshall: Good. I was hoping there would be a counter point. Stan: Yeah. 18, make ugly drawings. You're really good at that. Marshall: I've got that one going, yeah. Stan: I am just kidding. Marshall is really good actually.  Marshall: That is something I committed to and have been committed to it for years. Stan: Oh, come on! I was kidding. Marshall: Seriously. Stan: Number 19, exercise. Number 20, draw daily. 21, finish what you start.  22, discipline. is discipline a habit? They get it, like. Marshall: Yeah, okay. Did you - Stan: No. There's twenty three. So, the twenty-third one is, master your calendar.  And I think we've already kind of talked about that before but we had a scheduling episode. Okay. Thoughts on my 23. Marshall: It's a good list. And my first feeling is like, it's just it's hard to keep track of all of those things, so.  Well, here's what happens, as you read them and my mind races, it races in a couple directions that each one is a setup for the next one. Stan: Oh, it's not. Marshall: Say, 'no', and then say, 'yes' is a setup. Stan: Yes.  Marshall: Because truths come in contradictory pairs. The other is that some of them need to be elaborated. Stan: Oh, absolutely. Marshall: Yeah. So, should we put a one minute timer on each one of these things?  Stan: Before I do, is there anything that you were hoping would be on there that you didn't hear? Marshall: Hmm! It will occur to me as we go through them. Stan: Okay. So, there's the list.  Before we jump into it, I wanted to talk a little bit about, what is success anyway? Marshall: Good question. Stan: We kind of have to start with that.  And to me, the person that is trying to develop habits for success needs to first determine what success to them means. So, I see multiple things here.  Is it that you learned something during the process of making your drawing or painting? You know, it might not have become a good drawing but you learned a lot. That could be a successful session.  Is it that you would like your result or is it that you sold your result? Marshall: Because the most successful piece might be a piece that never sold. Stan: Sure. Marshall: Van Gogh's successes didn't sell. Stan: Well, he's just a big failure.  Marshall: Yeah. I mean, he would have been branded that way at the time. So, yes, we need to define it. Stan: Well, not we. I think everyone needs to define it for themselves and each piece could have a different motive.  Marshall: Didn't somebody ask, \"how do you set yourself up for success in the painting?\" Stan: Yes. How do you set yourself up? My answer to that was going to be, \"well, what do you mean of success?\" Marshall: So, the first thing to do is to define what you mean. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: Yes.  Stan: If you mean that you're going to like your result or you're going to sell it, well, the best way to set up yourself up for success is to just get really good at drawing or painting. That's the best way. Marshall: Yeah. Connect with the market also.  Even if you aren't good at drawing and painting but you've got a market that likes this particular thing that would be successful selling. Stan: True. Marshall: Have you seen the Currier and Ives prints? Stan: Maybe. Marshall: This is from the 19th century.  Currier and Ives put together these prints that sold everywhere in the United States. And they were a commercial success. They were the Thomas Kincade success of the 19th century.  And when you look at them now, they are just so unimpressive. But the fact that they were prints that you could buy for a reasonable a reasonable amount and put them in your living room made them sell gazillions of them.  So, they were very successful but nobody really looks back at them now as good art. That's an example of someone who was financially successful even if our historians don't fawn over them. Stan: Cool. You want to jump into the list or do you have? Marshall: Yeah. Let's jump into the list.  Let's do these one minute at a time. I put a-- Charlie, can you put a timer on them for one minute? Stan: Oh, jeez! Charlie: I'll start the clock. There is no way. Marshall: We can use less than minute and then, if we need an extra minute, we can appeal. Stan: Do we each get a minute? Marshall: No. Because you might have something to say.  Stan: 23 x 2 minutes will end up being 46 minutes, total. Marshall: Yeah. That's too long. Stan: There's no way. Then we're not getting through this episode. This is going to take forever. Marshall: One minute per topic. Stan: I predict, we get through half of them and we're like oh there's the show.  [chuckle] Stick around for next week. Marshall: Go. Stan: First one is, draw from life. You begin. Marshall: Everybody says that. Stan: Everyone says that. Marshall: Yeah.  Stan: Well, it's useful because photographs don't capture everything especially if you're painting. Color information is lost. So much of it is lost.  Also, the ability to take a 3D object that you're seeing and transform it into a 2D picture is a very important skill, I think. But if you're drawing from a photograph, you're not making that translation.  You're going from 2D to 2D. Marshall: And they are two different things. Stan: Yes. Marshall: Leyendecker was not into using photographs. Rockwell eventually began using photographs.  Leyendecker believed that you work from the three-dimensional thing that is in your environment, that when you move your head back and forth, it's going to change. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: Dawn Lagerberg even suggested that Michelangelo- Charlie: That's one minute. Marshall: Minute's up? Stan: Minute's up. No.  Marshall: Give me give me twenty seconds. Stan: [chuckle] That's what I thought would happen. Marshall: Dawn Lagerberg suggested Michelangelo was working from the figure and moving his head like this and moving his head like this and kind of spreading it. They do have a quality like that. And you're not going to get that from a photograph in the same way that you're going to get it  when you've got this complex thing of going from 3D to 2D. But drawing from life is what everybody-- I mean, it's one of the first things on everybody's list. Stan: And I think that drawing from life helps you get better at drawing from photographs. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: So, anyway, yeah, cool. There's that habit. Marshall: Well, we went over a minute.  Stan: We've been what? Under a minute, is that what you said? Marshall: Over a minute, yeah. Stan: Okay. We did not go under a minute. Marshall: We are not doing good. Charlie: Time works in weird ways. Stan: You're on what? Einstein time, is that what you guys - Marshall: Yeah. Stan: Number, uh, I like this one. Marshall: Okay. Stan: Number two is, draw in your head.  What I mean by that is, when you're not in the studio, you don't have a sketchbook, let's say you're driving and there's these clouds, maybe not when you're driving. Well, I've done it when I was driving. But when you're just sitting, you are having a picnic and there's these beautiful clouds  in the sky, instead of trying to find the pictures, instead paint a picture in your head of this thing that you're seeing. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: You know, what are the edges? Where would you put the sharp edges? Where would you put the soft edges? What color gradations would you put?  How would you mix those colors? You would start making these micro decisions in your head. You don't have to paint the whole picture. But just start making these little decisions and making it a habit where you don't have to force yourself to paint the picture in front of you. It just naturally happens.  You look at something and you're like how would I solve this? Marshall: Yeah. Stan: What are the simple forms of this guy? Marshall: Yeah. Actions usually come out of thoughts anyway, an imagination anyway, so you're essentially preparing yourself to do a better drawing by doing in the work. Charlie: That's the minute. Marshall: It's a minute?  Stan: Shut up Charlie. We are having a good conversation. [chuckle] Marshall: Give me 15 seconds. Okay, now I'm going to ask for 20. When my colleagues and I were trying to be illustrators, we would spent a long evening with Jim Lam. He was very generous with his time.  And we asked him, \"do you do comp studies?\" because we had been told \"do comp studies, that's a responsible professional thing to do\". And he paused for a long time before he answered. I think I know it was going on in his head. If I tell them the truth, I'll be a bad influence. And if I lie, I lie.  But what came out of his mouth was, \"I do a lot of comp studies in my head\". And thought, you earn the right to that. You do a lot of comp studies eventually you will be able to imagine what you would do. Stan: Yeah.  So, number three is, become your own best critic. Alright. So, what I mean by that is, you have to be able to increase your feedback loop.  We talked about the feedback loop several episodes ago, where in order to improve, you need to constantly get feedback on your actions to learn anything.  And so, be creative with how you get that feedback. You can't rely on a teacher all the time to give it to you. So, for example, when I was a student and I was really trying to improve my proportions,  because it was just always off and I was getting frustrated, I would draw from a photograph specifically for this exercise. I would then draw it 1:1 scale. And then, I would scan my drawing in so there's no proportion distortion with my camera angle  or anything. And then, I would overlay my drawing onto the photograph and I would check myself where my proportions are off. I wasn't relying in anybody else. And I could constantly do this over and over again at home and improve my proportions without a teacher. So, that was an improving- Charlie: That's a minute. Stan: Wow!  Increasing my feedback loop, speed and quantity with that. Marshall: Yeah. So, that's becoming your most efficient critic. That you can just you can do this quickly. You've got a feedback loop within you. You got a feedback loop with this apparatus. Stan: Yeah.  So, should I remove the word best from that? Marshall: Maybe, become your own critic. Stan: Become your own critic. Okay, yeah. There you go. \"Become your own critic\". Marshall: And that opens up the whole thing of how you can be too much of a cheerleader for yourself and you can also be too hard on yourself like Rafael was.  Stan: Cool. Do you have anything to add to that? I know we ran out of the minute, but. Marshall: No. That's good. Become your own critic. A lot of people are dependent on teachers. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: And a good teacher's job is the same job of a parent, to make it so that this  person doesn't need me anymore. Stan: Yeah. Number four, get information from multiple sources. This is one I'm thinking of cutting because I don't have too much info. But what I have on here is one of the most useful ways to learn is from multiple sources.  It's allows you to level up faster by seeing where the information from each source overlaps. And lays the focus to your attention there on those areas of overlap. And it's also a good way that you don't end up being a copycat of like one artist.  Marshall: Indeed. Multiple sources, multiple teachers too. Stan: You seem to be really into that one when I was reading the list. What was it about? Marshall: Yes. One of the problems that is with multiple sources is they can be confusing. They'll have some people say, \"Don't do this.\", and another person says, \"That's the key to everything.\" That happens all the time.  Contradictory advice. So, it can be confusing. And that's where mentorship comes in because a mentor is a person who looks at you and being your own critic, saying being your own mentor, looking - you say, what do I need  to reach my goal and then be able to discern what is going to help and what isn't? But multiple sources helps balance you out and it keeps you from becoming too tunnel  visioned into one particular style or one particular skill at the expense of others. Charlie: That's a minute. Stan: Cool. Awesome. Marshall: Made it? Stan: Yeah. Number five, train like an athlete. Marshall: Mm-hmm.  Stan: So, you know, Anders Ericsson came up with the whole 10,000 hour rule that everyone always mentions. Marshall: Yap. Stan: And I think that one of the biggest things that they miss is 10,000 deliberate  hours of practice because you can have 10,000 really crappy hours of practice and get nowhere. So, bite-sized sessions of practice.  So, for example, you're learning to play basketball, you're not just going to play a bunch of games of basketball. You do, but you have to learn how to shoot a free-throw.  And so, you'll go and you'll have a long session of free throws, three-pointers. Sessions of just controlling the ball. Juggling. Juggling. [chuckling] really well. Whatever.  You know, all those micro skills that need to be done. Going to the gym just getting strong. Doing sprint's to get faster. Charlie: That's a minute. Stan: Oh, god. I'm trying to talk fast and this is impossible. Marshall: I know it's hard.  Stan: But like let's say that in order to get good at basketball, someone really does just play a bunch of basketball. They're not going to have the ball most of the time. Most of the time that they're going to play that hour session, they're just running back  and forth and they're not actually using that hour as efficiently as possible. They're just running back and forth, and then sometimes, they'll get the ball and they'll shoot. Maybe, what? Like 20, 30 times they'll shoot in an hour?  Marshall: This is a great example of a topic that needs a whole- Stan: Okay. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: Right. So, anyway, when you learning to draw, train like that. Divide it up into specific skills that you want to get better at and focus on them. That's, okay.  Marshall: I was started to put together material for a lecture called, \"lessons for artists from the military\". The military is something I never was inclined toward and never really that interested in.  But military training has a few things that a lot of artistic training is missing, mainly, rigor. Mainly, the serious is the training like an athlete take this really seriously. It also has some things that I think that are not good for art students.  Stan: Like what? Marshall: Deprivation and making it harder. Putting you up to the test to try to break you essentially and so you're right back up from there.  That's one of the things that I wouldn't recommend in training. But that's the kind of thing that's necessary when it's life or death stakes is to see how hard you can push something. But it may be that there are some people I mean, Kim Jung Gi was in the military.  And I've had students who came out of the military that their work ethic was remarkable. There was absolutely no slacking. Stan: That's one of the other habits on here, is discipline, that you can get out of there. Something like that. Marshall: Okay. Let's keep going then.  Stan: Well, one thing before we move on is that, I do think it's still important to play a full game of basketball on a regular basis. Marshall: It's not just practice. Stan: Yeah. Don't just break it up. You have to combine the skills as well regularly. Marshall: Okay. Stan: So, they're both important.  Anyway, number six, break big things into smaller things. Isn't that what I just said? Marshall: Yeah. And it's also the thing that as you were giving a list of 23 things I was thinking, \"okay, how can we consolidate?\"  Stan: This is literally what I just- well kind of. It's not skills, it's like you break things up like if you say I want to get good at anatomy, then you have to make that really overwhelming task into a less overwhelming task.  Like, I want to get good at arms or just hands and just focus on that for a while because that is a lot easier than saying, 'I want to get good at anatomy. It's like, 'where do I even begin'?  Marshall: I like to begin with guy want to get good at a stick figure skeleton. And even just make them sticks that aren't even thick sticks, just lines. And that's a great way to get a holistic view of the body but it's also simple enough to  where you broken it down and I've got the stick figures. Now, I'll turn them into pipes. Now, I'll turn them into boxes. Now, I'll put clumps of muscles on them. So, it's breaking something as complex as anatomy into something that makes some sense. Once you can animate a stick figure, invent a stick figure, you're on your way.  Stan: How long do they spend on the stick figure? Marshall: Well, it depends. We're supposed to keep- how long are we supposed to spend on each one of these? One minute. Stan: Oh, no. Marshall: The question just opened it up. Charlie: About, there we go. That's a minute. Stan: Oh, really? Charlie: Yap. Stan: Hey, that one was perfect. Marshall: Hey!  Stan: Number seven, protect your most creative time. I think we've talked about this. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: It's like, if you're really productive at night, do that. Make sure you got that time. If you're really productive in the morning, don't have things scheduled during that time. Marshall: Yeah.  Stan: You know, keep it or just don't fill up that time with other things. Keep that as your creative time when you are doing your most important things. Don't do emails during your most important time. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: Or a most creative time. Marshall: That's a big one. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: I don't have anything to add. Stan: Yeah, okay.  Ding. We just blasted through that one. Charlie: 30 seconds. Stan: 30 seconds, wow! Record time! Number 8, go beyond the minimum requirements. Oh, yeah. So, it's like, if you're in school and your teacher assigns you something, don't just  do the minimum just because it's an assignment. Like, go beyond it, do more just because you want to or because you're curious about another aspect of it or apply that lesson to your own project.  Don't just do the bare minimum because someone's making you do it. That's the point. Marshall: It is the subversive energy of under promising and over delivering. There's something that's actually fun about it. Say, \"I want to see how well I can do it\".  My favorite example, even though it's pretty extreme, is Bernie Wrightson Frankenstein illustrations. He did, I don't know how many there were, maybe 40, but he did a number of them that  he took to finish and said \"this is not good enough\". They were actually excellent. Stan: Did they make it into the book? Marshall: No. They are in another book called A Look Back. But I have them. Stan: You have it?  Marshall: I mean, I have images of them. Stan: Did you bring it? Marshall: No. But we can show them. Stan: Okay, cool. Charlie: That's a minute. Marshall: Some of them- Stan: Shut up, Charlie. Marshall: Some of them would have been good enough but he was using cross-hatching.  Decided he didn't want to use cross-hatching, switched over to the Franklin Booth technique, had a nicer technique, did some beautiful lovely pieces like that but then decided they still aren't as good as I can do. So, he went way beyond the minimum requirement. Stan: Yeah.  Did they get better? Marshall: Yes, they did get better. Stan: Wow! Okay, cool. Marshall: So, there is an example of someone who had an inner critic that was enough to say, 'Why just do it okay? Why not do it my best?' Stan: That could just keep going forever though, right? Marshall: It could.  And it can turn into obsession compulsion and it can burn you out. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: That's a whole other story. Stan: Okay. Marshall: Okay. Stan: All right. Okay, number nine is, think like a kid. This is one that you were confused about? Marshall: I wasn't confused about it. Stan: You were curious about it?  Marshall: It's just that it's a big general topic. Think like a kid, all I'll think about is candy and gum. Stan: [chuckle] God damn. Do you hear that noise? Marshall: The trash. Stan: Oh, the trash man. Okay. Well, let me read this to you.             Marshall: I love the sound of trash trucks They represent relief from too much garbage.  I'm okay with leaving it in. Stan: Well, I'm going to read it to you anyways, so. Marshall: Okay. Stan: Quick, think fast. Oh, this is to you. Okay. Think, quick fast. When asked, what can you do with a paper clip, how many alternate uses could you come up with?  Marshall: My first inclination is violence toward a brother. I'm sorry that it's that way. Stan: That's great. [laughter] How many total can you come up with? Marshall: In a limited amount of time? Stan: 10 seconds. Yeah, go.  Marshall: In 10 seconds, it can be used as a weapon to pinprick my brother when he's giving me grief. It can be turned into a bow. It can be tied into a bow but you have to be really good with your fine motor skills to do this.  It can be used to short-circuit the electricity in the house so that the grown-ups will have some trouble and won't give us any. Stan: Yeah. You don't have to give a reason, just give me the uses. Charlie: [chuckle] Now you are thinking like MacGyver. Stan: Just give me the uses, don't come up with the reasons. Marshall: Oh, okay.  It can be scrubbed around on the concrete until you turn it into just silver dust. [chuckle] You go on now. Stan: There's literally like an infinite amount.  The point of that one was that, most people will just come up with like 10 to 15. And the 10 seconds was just for you. There wasn't supposed to be a time limit. Marshall: Okay. Stan: But most people will just be like, \"I don't know what else it could be used for\". It's like it could be anything.  It could be used to put in my pocket. It could be used to tie my hair. Or to connect these two cups together. It could be used as decoration around my finger.  It could be used to make my nose bleed. To make myself blind. Like you can just keep going forever. You can be used to throw across the room.  [chuckle] The point is that, when you get that habit of just like thinking outside the box of what something could be used for and just thinking in a weird way, it can make  your art better. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: You can come up with solutions that you wouldn't have thought of if you were just trying to like be logical about, okay, what's the best thing a paperclip could be used for? Marshall: Yeah. You set aside assumptions. Stan: Yeah. Charlie: Is that how Clippy was born? Stan: Clippy?  The Microsoft? Charlie: The paperclip. Stan: That seems like it's thinking inside the box though. Charlie: Yeah. Stan: So, it gets you solutions that might surprisingly be kind of cool.  Marshall: That's a basic creative exercise although they probably wouldn't be called think like a kid. And there will be different titles for how to designate it. But going into the hardware store to look for art supplies, it's a great idea.  Fishing tackle, you get cheaper things that instead of spending eighty five dollars for an art band, you'll spend fifteen dollars for a little fishing tackle thing that fits better. But going outside of what the expected norms are, exercises like that.  Stan: I think that's really good for concept designers, character designer, anyone that's designing anything new that's supposed to not just be what everyone's already seen. Marshall: To see things freshly. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: See things analogically.  Stan: But you were saying that it shouldn't be like think like a kid, why? Marshall: I like think like a kid but kids think all sorts of different ways. So, we need to- they see things freshly is one thing.  Stan: Well, April in here wrote that \"researchers say that 98% of five-year-olds are qualified as highly creative whereas only Marshall: % of 15 year olds are qualified as well there\". Marshall: Right.  Well, there's another thing and that is the social fear that happens when you've been tested. Stan: Of being weird of coming up with new ideas, yeah. Marshall: People will have made fun of you. Whereas, when you're five years old, you probably, if you've been in a relatively sheltered environment before you've gone out and been socialized, you're going to dare to say things that other  people are going to make fun of later but you've been safe doing that. That's what I have observed about it. Is that you're okay. In fact, just when you said, \"Things you can do with a paperclip. Ten seconds.\" There is immediate, this pressure, this fear, \"what if I say something stupid?\"  And that's the thing that chokes it off. Stan: If you said something stupid, I would be more impressed. That's what I was looking for. Marshall: That's right. But did you notice the dynamic that when you said, it's because there's all of this, don't let that out, that might be a stupid thing.  Stan: That one is stupid don't say that one. What's the other one? Marshall: So, it helps to do this in private and it helps to do this or it helps to do this with someone you are completely at ease with. I have been the most creative in my life when with a friend on a road trip. Stan: Are you not at ease with me?  Marshall: Yeah. But not when the camera is on me and you're saying \"what are the ten -\" Stan: HD Camera. 4K cameras? Marshall: When I did it you, when I said that's how you do, You do the same thing. It's and there's this tension that comes in. Stan: Shut up Marshall. I'm creative.  Marshall: When you're not facing someone directly, when you're side-by-side, somebody said that that makes a difference that you're not looking at each other where there could be critical feedback. You're both facing the same world. And then you just start improvising.  It's amazing how effortlessly and funny and enjoyable it can be because all fear is stripped away. We're both fools. Stan: [chuckle] Yeah. Okay. Charlie, are we out a minute yet?  Charlie: We are at six minutes. Marshall: [chuckle] We are at about six minutes. Stan: Six minutes? Snaps. Okay. Number ten is, research, research, research. Marshall: Research. Let's think like a grown-up. Stan: I think. Marshall: Well, no actually, it isn't.  Because if you watch kids when they get interested in something, they research, research, re- they will get every resource they can find on it and pour themselves into it. So, that's why thinking like a kid is such a broad category.  But research, research, research, by the time you get to responsible research, you are doing grown-up tasks. Stan: Yes. Okay. So, this one is, I don't know if it's a habit, it's kind of - it's more of just like a step in a project.  Marshall: Yeah. Stan: I don't know if this would be a habit. We might remove this one. But I think it is important.

Marshall: Yes. A student of mine who was a very good student and went on to- he's had a lot of success  over a decade in the game industry. When he got his first job and I talked to him a few months after he got that job and I said, \"Tell me what you're observing.\" And he said, \"Well, there's one thing that I was not taught in school that is like one of the most important things.\" What's that?  \"Research.\" Most of this job is research. That's what we spend a big chunk of everything is just finding out what this is going to look like. What that looks like. What's the real use of those things? And so, they are spending tons of time doing that. Stan: Yeah.  I do a lot of research for every single one of my lessons. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: That's like one of the biggest part. I think we spend more time on research than writing and production. Marshall: Yeah.  So, how it applies to habits of success research, research, research. It's not even something that you - Stan: It's not. I don't think it's a habit. Marshall: Yeah. And it's also not even something you have to recommend to people who are interested in it.  They just- think about the child who does not do well in school but they just don't do well in school. They do great when it comes to researching their favorite topic. Stan: Yeah. But some people don't do research and you need to tell them like, \"Hey, do a little  bit more research on this and improve on it.\" You know, like let her know. You've taught like character design or concept design classes, were there any students that are designing some kind of character but they know nothing about what this character would be like?  Marshall: Yeah. Stan: And you tell them, \"Hey! None of this is authentic. Go figure out why things would look the way they are first.\" Does that ever happen? Marshall: Yes. That happens all the time with clothes. A lot of artists don't pay attention to clothes. Stan: Yeah.  Marshall: Howard Pyle researched, he would not allow a button on us a Revolutionary War coat if it was the kind of button you would use on a Civil War coat. He cared about that. NC Wyeth less so, I'm told.  That it was more- its fantasy. You know, like, I can break some of the rules. It just has to look cool. But where do we go with this? Stan: That's it. We are out of time. Marshall: Okay. Stan: All right. Are we only at number 11? Marshall: Can you believe it?  Stan: Huh! I'm already tired. Marshall: Better anyway. Stan: I need some coffee. Marshall: You'll get your drug. Stan: All right. Number 11 is patience. [chuckle] Oh my god, that's funny. Marshall: Patience we're exercising it.  You got one minute. You got one minute. Come on. Get going. Stan: That's so funny. Marshall: So, patience is one that a number of the frustrated people who've sent voicemails and asked questions about, \"how can I help myself?\"  That's been a major theme is that you can't expect it to happen quickly. Stan: Yeah. I think most people expect it to happen much faster than it will happen. And the frustration, we talked about this several episodes ago, is that the frustration  really hurts your progress. If you're patient, you learn to enjoy the process and it doesn't matter if you ever really get there because you're having fun the whole time. Marshall: I've always sensed this about you. I've always sensed that when you are on a project that you might not have yield from  it for a year to three or more. Stan: Five? Marshall: Yeah. And that it doesn't bother you though. Or does it? Stan: A little bit but not much.  Marshall: But you seem aware that if we keep moving and Abraham Lincoln I think said, \"I walk slowly but I don't walk backward.\" That you are at least making progress and that over time it accumulates.  And if you had just stopped it wouldn't happen, so. But yes, I've always sensed that about you. You've got a long term view in mind. Stan: Sometimes I feel like you just come up with a random quote and then assign like some famous celebrity to it. Marshall: No, I read.  Well, that is, I didn't do my research to look that up on the internet and make sure that it was Abraham Lincoln who said it. And that is the danger of saying this on the podcast. Is that we are going to have a number of people saying, Abraham Lincoln did not say that quote.  Stan: We should just start crediting random people for random quotes though. Marshall: I'll let you do that. Stan: Okay. Okay, are we done with that one? Marshall: Yeah. Stan: That one is pretty obvious.  Number twelve, draw things you enjoy. I think that's an obvious one too. If you are so focused on all this like strict discipline, constantly have to improve, like you lose the fun out of it.  The reason most people start drawing is that they liked it in the first place. And a lot of this stuff could really take the soul out of it all. So, you have to everyone is going to go back and just have some fun.  Marshall: Ray Bradbury talked about chasing loves. It's - that is what he did. He chased loves when he was a kid. He is got made fun of. He ended up burning his comic book collection I think because he was embarrassed by it. And then decided that will never happen again.  And that is kind of what he preached. Stan: Wait, he burned his comic collections? Marshall: His friends made fun of a kind of comic books that he likes so, in order to  ingratiate himself socially, he got rid of it all and then decided it was a mistake and that it doesn't make any difference what the people around me think. I am going to pursue this. And then he became Ray Bradbury. Stan: Remix your inspiration.  It is the art parents thing. Marshall: The art parents thing and the elements of style too because in order to remix, there comes a point where you have to decide which parts line, which parts tone, which parts color, which parts texture, what kind of shapes. Stan: Share what you learn.  Teaching to me was the thing that made me improve the most because when you have to teach, you have that pressure to really organize that information in a way that makes sense, not just to you but to everyone else.  And that is a higher standard of organizing the information. And also filling in the gaps that you didn't even know you had. It's like when you try to explain something, you realize that you don't fully understand it.  And so, you have to go back and do some research and figure out what it is that makes this true. Or you know, sometimes a student will ask you questions that you don't know the answer to. You have to go and learn that. So, yeah, teaching. Marshall: Yeah. I learned anatomy by teaching.  I learned perspective by teaching. I learned a lot about drawing by teaching. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: I tried learning perspective over and over and I could not figure it out from books. It was just, my brain didn't go there. But then, when I committed that in the fall I'm going to teach a class in perspective,  back in the '80s, I had one summer to get ready for it. And I recognized their stakes now. I have to know this. So, that helps. Robert Beverly Hale said, \"A little teaching can help you to learn on anatomy. But only a little.\"  And that brings the other thing is that eventually  you become better at explaining it than doing it. Stan: Right. You still have to draw. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: Right. Yeah, everyone thinks that I'm doing this to help other students and it's like no it's purely selfish. I am teaching so that I can get better.  Marshall: I think that the selfish motive for a teacher, if the motive is selfish, I'm going to teach this because I love the subject. But the goal is to help the students understand it the best they can.  That's a good combination of this is, the motive is selfish, the goal is altruistic. Stan: Yeah. I'm just kidding. Marshall: Oh, well then I shouldn't have said what I said. Stan: No. Take it back Marshall.  Number fifteen, spent time with other artists. This is the whole group thing. We talked about this a little bit at our comic-con panel. Marshall: Uh-huh. Stan: You know, being part of a community. You guys keep each other up.  It makes things that are not fun, more fun. It's easier to practice when you're practicing with a group of people. All right? Because even if you have what you consider a bad drawing at the end of your practice session, at least you still had fun with these peers, right?  Marshall: Mm-hmm. Stan: It's a lot easier to go back and do it again tomorrow or whatever if you know you're going to have fun either way. Marshall: Mm-hmm. In The Talent Code, didn't he focus on that?  That you've got the Italian Renaissance is actually happening in Florence all within a few blocks of itself because of community. And then you've got areas where soccer teams and hit songwriters.  He talked about how you get environments where a person who might not be considered talented, when they go into that environment become talented because of the environment.  And certainly, there is a disproportionate ratio of people who became great comic book artists in the 20th century who came out of New York. And even more specifically, out of the LaGuardia High School where so many of those Mad Magazine  artists went and they were learning. They were in a community where everybody was sort of caught this fever. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: Makes a big difference. I see it as a huge thing. Stan: I started doing an impression and I gave up immediately. Marshall: Go ahead. Stan: No.  Marshall: Give it another shot. You can always add it to that. Stan: I have to hear it before I could actually do it. Marshall: An impression of what? Stan: The only cure is more cowbell. Charlie: More cowbell. Stan: More cowbell. [chuckle] Marshall: I don't even know it. Charlie: I've got a fever and the only prescription is more cowbell.  Stan: There you go. That was way better. Marshall: That was better. I don't even know the illusion. [chuckle] Charlie: Christopher Walken, Saturday Night Live. Stan: Oh, jeez!                                       Marshall: Oh, okay. Say no. Marshall: No. Stan: Say no. No. You said it?  Okay. Stupid. Okay, so you say no to things. I know that there was a period in my life when I have to start saying no because too many opportunities are starting to come up.  Too many people were asking for things and I started just coming up with too many of my own new projects and it was just way too much to handle. And I have to just start dropping things. Marshall: Yeah.  Stan: And eventually, I just started saying 'no' to commissions. Like I can't do these commissions because it is taking time away from proko. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: It's like I need to make these lessons. Sorry, I can't paint this. I can't paint your grandson, you know. Marshall: Yeah.  Stan: Even though it was extra money, I had to say 'no' to a lot of different things. And I think that's important. You have to figure out what your goals are and everything that comes your way, every idea that you have, you have to bring it back and analyze it with your ultimate goals because  it is really easy to just start going sideways. Marshall: I don't do that. Well, I say 'yes' way too much. Seth Godin said that, \"What you say 'no' to is almost as important as what you say 'yes' to. Stan: Yeah.  Because if you say 'yes' to something that was going to take you away from some other 'yes' then you're saying 'no' to that other 'yes' by saying 'yes' to that other 'yes'. Marshall: It's a default no. Yes, yes, no. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: What's the next one?  Stan: Saying 'no'. Wait, no, saying 'yes'. Marshall: I said, \"Yes.\". I said, \"Yes.\", to this podcast. Stan: You did. Marshall: Yeah. That was a resounding yes. You said, \"Yes.\" to it too. So, we did that.  Stan: This one is for- this is a different reason 'no'. A lot of people say 'no' to things just because they think they're not ready. They're scared. Marshall: Mm-hmm. Stan: That's the reason you say 'yes' to things. Not just because like, yeah take on every opportunity.  It's like no, if you're scared of something and you think it's going to be a big challenge, say 'yes'. It will help you get better. Marshall: That's why I said 'yes' to this- that is a portion of why I said 'yes' to this podcast. Stan: Okay.  Marshall: Is that, if I had said 'no' it would have been I just don't want to be in front of a camera. I don't want to be put on the spot and have a conversation that goes out to the world. And I thought it was fear. Stan: Yeah. Fear would have prevented great things from happening. Marshall: It was fear. Stan: Yeah. Stan: Yeah. Oh, this one is yours.  Make ugly drawings. [chuckle] Take the lead Marshall. Marshall: Yeah, that one is mine. Stan: I'm just kidding. Marshall: Well, should I tell my story? Stan: I'm just kidding. You don't make ugly drawings. Marshall: I do.  Oh, you don't think I make ugly drawings? Stan: Well, no. Everyone makes ugly drawings. Marshall: Yeah, yeah. Stan: But it is not like you all your drawings are ugly, that's the joke. Marshall: I had such terrible handwriting in school that there were meetings with teachers about Marshall's handwriting.  And when I went to college and decided I'm going to be an illustrator, I switched from handwriting to printing because I could control printing.  And because my drawing was so sloppy, I started doing really tight technical stuff and made my living doing that. And part of the midlife crisis was that that is all you can do, is the careful and controlled and planned stuff.  So, I started a sketchbook, 1997, and filled it with thousands of messy drawings. And then, reached another level.  And then started to realize I still got problems and I've been going through the last ten years or so. Has been another. Just do one, after another, after another and lose control over them. Nine out of ten, maybe ninety-nine out of a hundred, will fail.  But those few that do come together are things that would never have happened if you had tried to do it slow motion. You're letting the randomness take over. And that is the main thing I'm interested in right now. Stan: So, you were intentionally making them sloppy? Marshall: Yes, I was. Which is not necessarily a good idea. Stan: Yeah.  I was going to say that is a bad idea. Marshall: That's what I found out. But my thinking was that because I was so afraid of ugly that free to do ugly was as free as I could get. But it got me into the habit of tolerating ugly.  So, my next alternative was just saying that they've got a be done fast. Do you know about the eight minute draw? It was popularized in the cartooning book by- I want to say, it's an Italian name.  I'm sorry I'm missing it. Stan: Luigi. Is that Italian? Marshall: It's a cartooning book. And the eight minute draw is an exercise within this book on cartooning. I would like to say the guy's name. Anyway, well, I can say it later.  Charlie: It's Ivan Brunetti or Yvonne Brunetti. Marshall: You draw something for four minutes then you take a breath. You draw it for two minutes. Stan: Wait, you hold your breath the all the time? Marshall: Yeah, well, you've been in a state I've got a four minute timer on me. Stan: Okay.  You take a break. Marshall: You take a breath. You draw it for two minutes, you take another breath. You draw it for one minute. Then you draw it for thirty seconds. Then you do it for I think- Stan: So, you're starting a new drawing every time? Marshall: No. It's the same thing.  Stan: But it's a different drawing. You starting over. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: You're not continuing on the same. Marshall: That is right. You are starting over. I can show examples. Stan: Okay. Marshall: The final one that you do is five seconds. And when you are trying to draw an airplane or two people wrestling and you've got five  seconds to do it, you've got to make lines that quickly and it's interesting how gestural those lines become. It's a great exercise. Stan: That sounds fun. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: That doesn't sound like you're intentionally being messy. Marshall: No.  You're intentionally being fast and it brings out the part of you that is focused on 'I've got to get this done', which gets past self-consciousness. Which means that you can- sometimes those 30-second drawings end up being the best drawings.  Seldom do the four, in my experience, seldom do the four-minute ones end up being the best. Stan: I really like that. That's not really cool exercise. Marshall: Yeah. Okay. Well, that had to deal with. Let's trace back what was the issue here. Stan: Well, my whole point about saying make ugly drawings wasn't to intentionally do bad drawings.  It's to not be afraid of the failure of a bad drawing. Marshall: Yeah, yeah. Stan: I think a lot of students get debilitated by the fear of the failure of a bad drawing. They get demotivated. They quit. They get frustrated.  It's like, \"oh, you did a bad drawing? Okay. That was expected. You just started. Keep making those bad drawings\". Marshall: It's like in training you have got to get hit by a taser a few times until you know what it's like and you say, \"I can handle it.\" Stan: [chuckle] You are so random. Marshall: Okay. Make ugly drawings.  Something you don't need to preach at me anymore. Stan: Okay. Nineteen, exercise. Keep your body in shape. Marshall: Physically exercise. Stan: If you injure your shoulder or if you get carpal tunnel or if your back starts to  hurt because you're weak, you got a weak core. Like you're not going to- it's not going to be good in the long term to draw more an exercise less. That's my point. I think your brain is healthier if you exercise it.  Marshall: I read a creativity book years ago that I can't remember who wrote it but the first thing this author did was, I think it was the first chapter, is to physically exercise. How is that going to help me be creative? The claim was that it will help you do better at everything.  There's going to be- your brain is going to work better if your body is in shape. So, I thought, okay, I'll accept it and then go on see what else this guy's got. But there is a lot to be said for it. Stan: Yeah, as you can tell I've been exercising a lot. Marshall: Yeah. You CrossFit. Stan: CrossFit.  That was a long time ago. Marshall: I remember. I was really impressed that you- it was six years ago that you started CrossFitting, didn't you? Stan: I like the way you phrased that. It was six years ago when you started CrossFit as if I'm still doing. Marshall: Why did you stop?  Stan: I got injured. But not because of CrossFit. Marshall: Oh, okay. Stan: It wasn't because of CrossFit. It's so funny the way it happened. It's like, I was in class and literally in between exercises, I bent down to pick up  like I don't know, my shoe or something, I don't know what it was, and my back just gave out. Marshall: Really? Stan: Something happened. I think I was really tight. Marshall: Wow! Stan: I think I skipped like he stretching class that week and there were some really  intense heavy weights classes. And my back was just super tight and something happened. I think I like pulled a ligament or something. And I couldn't get up.  I fell to the ground, my back was like almost paralyzed for like 5 minutes. Marshall: I'm sorry to hear it. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: You seem like you're smiling and so everything is okay so we can laugh about it. Stan: I am fine. Marshall: Here's another thing about exercise.  Stan: Yeah. Marshall: If you're studying anatomy exercise is particularly good because you will be sore in the muscle that you're studying. Stan: Yeah, I heard that. Does that really matter? Marshall: I think it's a great idea. Stan: Yeah, but does this really connect? Marshall: Sure.  When I went through Goldfinger book, took six minutes to go through it, but I found every origin and insertion point of every muscle on the skeleton that I own and on myself. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: Except for the palmaris longus on the right hand it's gone. I don't have it. Stan: [chuckle] Where is this?  Are you missing it in both hands or both palms? Marshall: No.Just in the right hand. Stan: Oh, just in the right hand. Marshall: Yeah. And also when I exercise now, when I am sore, I'm more aware specifically what muscle that is and which portion of it is. So, yeah, it broadens knowledge, I think.  Stan: Yeah, okay, cool. Number twenty, I was going to say twenty something, it is twenty. Draw daily. That's an obvious one. Do we even continue? Marshall: No. Stan: Okay. Draw daily. Make it a habit. You'll draw more.  21, finish what you start. I know a lot of artists that constantly start new projects and they don't finish it because they get bored. Or about halfway through an illustration or really any project is when it gets hard.  Marshall: Yes. Stan: That's when the problem starts to happen. Your original idea, you're excited, you got that energy and then you start doing it and that energy slowly starts to go away and you start to actually having to put the work in  and solve problems and it gets less fun. And you have to develop the habit of pushing through that to a finish because if you constantly start new things, you'll never really do anything great.  Marshall: There is one problem with it. Sometimes, people come up with ideas, I had this problem for years. I'll come up with an idea. I say, \"Great.\", I get excited, I start the piece but it's going to be an 80 hour or 100 hour piece. And so, to keep pushing through and keep pushing through can wear you out.  And one of my colleagues told me, \"you do spend these 80-100 hour pieces\". Said, \"I have never in my entire career done a piece that's taken more than eight hours. And most of them take about an hour or two.\" They were a little pen and ink and watercolor things that he was well trained to do.  And so, that started to lead me to where I have to have a different style. I cannot have one of these styles that is every piece is going to take this much time if I'm not getting paid for them. These were the ones that I was doing for the joy of them. Stan: That comes to what you want to do. That's when you have to know have goals in mind.  If you're on the East Coast and you're doing those 100 hour drawings and that is what you want to do, then that's fine that you're spending so much time on it. But if it's not then yeah, why did you even start? Marshall: Mm-hmm. And usually that's the hot point of where the trouble is.  Why start on this if you're going to get bored with it? So, to have some criteria that says, this is a great idea or it's not a great idea. Or this is idea that I think going to get bored with. This one I'm going to shelve.  And that way, you're generating a lot of ideas but not yet making a commitment to any one of them. Stan: Sure, yeah. Generally ideas is good.  Also, I think it's good to give up on some ideas halfway through if you realize, okay, yeah, actually, no, I don't want to keep going with this. But if it's a habit to never finish a project that's a totally different thing.  Marshall: Yeah, yeah. I know. You're holding yourself accountable to carry some things through even through the awkward stages. Stan: Yeah. Just because there's a problem doesn't mean that it's a bad idea.  Most great things and difficult things have problems that have to be solved before you finish it. Anything else? Marshall: No. Stan: Okay. 22, discipline. Marshall: It's kind of the same thing as carry things through. Stan: Actually -  Marshall: Go ahead. What's the difference? Stan: For this one, I was just going to tell a little story. I don't know if I should mention a name. Probably shouldn't.  Well, anyway, I was talking to someone and he's a mentor to a lot of students. Not a lot but several. He does it for free.  He takes people into his home where he built a studio and he allows them to live there for free.  So, he pays for their room, he pays for their food, he provides them with art supplies and he gives them free lessons. This is like a dream come true for most artists.  And there was a girl that was going through his thing and then after like six months she was like I'm just going to quit. I'm too lazy. Marshall: Finding out how hard it was? Stan: Yeah.  Well, I guess it was too hard for her. I don't think his program is necessarily like really rigorous. He doesn't seem like a super strict dude to me. But she just realized like, I'm just a lazy person and I would rather just work at you  know, some minimum-wage job instead. Marshall: So, this is an example of a person who does not have discipline. Stan: Right. This is an extreme example. I just wanted to tell that story but, yeah. Marshall: In the research that Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, if I'm pronouncing his current name correctly,  do you know who he is? Stan: No. Marshall: He put together a 400 page book on creativity that came out I think back in the '90s. I spent months in that book. It was researched. It was not very practical but it had some very good things in it. It had some surprises in it.  One was that they found out how many people who are domain changers, people who are extremely creative, are lacking discipline in certain areas. And this is that say 'no', say 'yes'.  That in order to succeed at this thing, I will say no to organizing my checkbook or all of these other things or let somebody else take care of them so that I can focus entirely on that. So, discipline is selective.  I don't know that a person would want to be disciplined about everything. It seems like it would be they will be just even disciplined - Stan: There is a balance. Marshall: Yeah. Okay, be disciplined. That's number 22. Gosh we're so close to the edge. The anticipation is killing me.  Stan: Oh, 23 is mastering your calendar. And we had a full episode on that already so go back to that. Marshall: Okay. Stan: Unless you have something to add? Marshall: When I have mastered my calendar, I have been my most productive. When I have not I have been my least productive. So, there is that. Having an all difference.  Stan: Yeah. That's the full point. Basically, my thing is like have a weekly analysis of your previous week and then have a plan for the week to come. Start with that.  Every week, set a time and do that because then you'll be a lot more deliberate with the time. It's not about working all the time, it's about spending your time deliberately. It's choosing what you spend your time doing. That what it is like.  Marshall: Do you do it alone? Stan: What? Marshall: When you look at your calendar and assess it? Stan: There is a personal one that I do. And but then no, we have a scrum method that we do at proko here where the whole team every Monday- well, not every Monday, we do a two-week thing.  Marshall: I'm interested in that. Stan: Have we talked about that? Marshall: No. Stan: No? Oh, well, I am actually was going to bring up scrum as one of my things. Marshall: Shall we do a voicemail? Stan: Yeah, voicemails. Do we have a theme song for voicemails yet? Charlie: No, we don't.  Stan: I think Marshall, we need you to jingle something up for us. Marshall: Somebody had a great title for the voicemails. Stan: What was it? Marshall: I think it was m-a-l-e-s or something like that. Stan: Males. Oh my god. Male time? Marshall: Yeah.  It was something like that but it was clever than that. Charlie: Was it, Draftsmen, Draftsmale, Draftsmail. Like going through the different spellings. Stan: Draftsmen. Draftsmale. Draftsmail. Marshall: Whatever it was, it was funny.  Stan: That is clever. Marshall: Yeah. Stan: It would be a good animation but not necessarily for audio. What would that - Yeah. But I like that. That's the best one I've heard so far.  Charlie: Draftsmail still has a nice ring to it even if the whole preamble doesn't work. Stan: Yeah. Marshall: Let's hear one of those voicemails. Voicemail: Hi. I'm Autumn.  I'm 16 and I want to be a tattoo artist, um, when I'm older. One thing I need to work on is composition and with like such a complex and difficult canvas such as like the skin.  And that can be all shapes and sizes depending on where the tattoo would be. I need to learn how to like create a good composition that'll work from like multiple angles. So, I was wondering if you had any like advice or tips or exercises that I can work on to  create a clear composition that would work from multiple angles and like be dynamic and not too busy. Thank you. Marshall: This is one I could go on for a while. Stan: Really? Marshall: Yeah. Stan: I don't have much. Go ahead.  You are the composition man. Marshall: Well, also what happened with my style is that I found out tattoo artists and I had a lot in common even though I've never been a tattoo artist. The stuff in my sketchbook tattoo artist really connected with and I recognized I've got a  tattoo aesthetic. It's a low brow aesthetic like with graffiti. Albrecht D\u00fcrer work has got that kind of aesthetic.  And a lot of it came out of the the technical limitations that you're mentioning here that you've got lines that have to be graphically strong to hold this together. Subtlety is harder.  Like with Albrecht D\u00fcrer wood blocks, that you've got to have a really strong cut in line there. And so you get an aesthetic that is vulgar, it's not subtle. Even though I know that, don't take this wrong, I know that there are many tattoo artists  who do remarkably subtle work, but the medium itself, historically has lent itself to not being subtle. To making it so you've got skulls and things breaking through them that that are graphically strong.  But the question about composition and how to make it look right or how, I can't remember how you phrased it. You look at the history - Charlie: Work in multiple angles because it is the canvas of the human body. Marshall: Multiple angles. Oh, yeah. You've got a curved canvas. Charlie: Yeah.  Marshall: I can't give you anything specific on that. I can tell you this, the first thing you would do is something we're going to devote a session to or one of these podcasts to, is to know the history of your craft.  So, look at how tattooing evolved to look at why it looks the way it does and to get one of these collections.  Taschen has a collection of tattoos throughout history, I think, that is fascinating to look at because you're going to see almost every problem that you're going to run into, people have run into in past centuries.  And so, here's how they've solved it. So, that's the first thing, it gives you an overview of the craft you're pursuing. And that way, you don't have to reinvent the wheel.  The second thing is to choose touchstones from outside this world of tattooing. In fact, the things that are the most different that you can imagine and that way you bring ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "What is the extreme opposite of tattoos mentioned?", "Question 2": "Which artists are compared to tattoos in the text?", "Question 3": "What are precious moments described as in the text?", "Question 4": "How should one study styles according to the text?", "Question 5": "What is the purpose of designing around skin?", "Question 6": "What does 'scrum' refer to in this context?", "Question 7": "How are tasks prioritized in a scrum framework?", "Question 8": "What is the significance of repetition in viewing content?", "Question 9": "Why might multiple readings of a text be valuable?", "Question 10": "What do listeners need to do on iTunes?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "precious moments", "Answer 2": "Monet, Renoir, and some of the French Impressionists.", "Answer 3": "about as extreme as you could get", "Answer 4": "You should study styles by learning the history of your craft and understanding why things looked the way they did, while also looking at something completely unrelated that interests you to see if you can create a combination or breeding of ideas.", "Answer 5": "The purpose of designing around skin is to get creative by designing around hair tracts or around muscle fibers with or against the striations.", "Answer 6": "Scrum refers to a method of working for teams that involves collaboration, consisting of meetings where everyone updates each other on progress, and organizing tasks into sprints with assigned point values to manage workloads.", "Answer 7": "In a scrum framework, tasks are prioritized during each sprint planning session where team members come up with a list of tasks they think they can complete in the designated sprint duration.

Again, he won't say what that is yet. He's going to be talking more about what contact may look like when it happens in the upcoming Sedona transmission in September. But  that's his latest prediction, and and I've actually heard a couple of other psychics say something very similar, like open contact and disclosure, and the introduction of ETs to  humanity is only a few years away. It's really close. So it's been echoed by several other psychics independently. So something is happening that is happening in our consciousness  that has made us ready for the first steps of contact. I think. Well, if that does happen, from what you told me before, is like if Bashar showed up today and walked off of a spaceship and and walked towards us, we wouldn't be able to handle his  frequency. Right frequency would be so much how I'm assuming that the contact that's coming is that a frequency that we can handle? Yes, so it's something more similar to us, something that would be more humanoid, something we can handle at  first, something of a frequency and and you have to also remember that the the, well, I again, I not saying that this event means they're going to land and step out, right? It's,  it's an event. I don't know what that means, but we'll see. It could be in the front the White House front lawn. It could be. I doubt it. I doubt it too, yeah, but it will be something  that is unquestionable. So obviously they would know what they're doing and it would be something we can handle. So they will leave it up to us in terms of how to react to that, but it will be something we can probably handle. Otherwise, it  would make no sense to do it, if there would be no point so and even when beings are introduced, I think they will be of a type that's more genetically related to us, something we can relate to, something that's easier for us to take. And over time, we  would be introduced to other species that are more different than we are. As we get used to the ones that are more like us, we can start to expand and say, Okay, now let's look at the ones that are not so much like us. And now we're really  understanding a different culture and a different frequency, but they'll probably do it in a way that allows us the opportunity to gradually raise our frequency to match those frequencies later on as well. Because again, if they don't do it that way, it would, it would make no sense.  What would what humanity do? What's your opinion of, what, what I mean? I mean, if UFOs show up. I mean, we've been trained by movies in Hollywood, which you've been part of, actually, literally making Star Trek, of of these kind of like  evil aliens, or Independence Day, which we've discussed on other shows, like it's not, it's not possible to have the aliens come in who are going to here, to be to take takeover, because their frequency has to be at a certain level to even be able to have that technology to even come here. So if they're here,  they're not going to come over to take over or to mine for gold or steal our water or anything like that. That's not what they're coming here to do. So when that event happens, based on, we just talked about, what, what movies tell us about, time  travel, what movies tell us about, uh, aliens, even, the even, even ones that work with us is how humanity works together. It seems like all everything kind of goes away.  The hate you. You hate me. Listen, we're humans. We're not different countries, we're not different races. We're humans now, and we have something else out there and we join. Is that? What do you think will happen? Ultimately?  Yes, we will start. Thinking of Earth as our home, as opposed to a specific country. I think ultimately and again, this, I think part of the reset that we talked about, from 2020, to 2050, over that 30 year period. I think at the end of it, we  will be basically joining a galactic society in some way, shape or form, maybe on the bottom rung as new members, but nevertheless becoming part of something much, much bigger,  that opens the doorway to humanity's evolution in a way that's never been done before. So I don't think that's really overly optimistic, because I know there's a lot going on  behind the scenes here, both on Earth and for the alien from the aliens point of view. And when that starts coming to light, I think people's eyes will be open to what's been going on all this time that we haven't been paying attention to, and suddenly we  will be introduced to a whole other level of reality and a whole other level of potentiality for humanity. And we'll just go, oh, okay, this is pretty limitless. This is where we're going from here. This is where we're going to wind up. So  I think we're going to see that over the next couple of decades. Yeah. I mean, you're essentially, I mean, this essentially the plot of Star Trek First Contact, where, sort of, they shoot off, they shoot off a rocket, and that technology catches the eye  of someone, and they come in, and that introduces humanity into a galactic community. It's essentially something along those lines. Basically.  Basically, yeah, obviously, and, but the thing is, it's just when you're saying these things out loud, it seems so out there, sure, and I mean, I I'm on board. I'm on board. I believe,  I think this was, I think this is something that's going to happen in one way, shape or form, but it just seems so far removed from where we are right now as a society. Here's the thing about that. We're talking about a fragment  of society that feels this way, which there are culture that is going to be surprised by this, okay, as as if it hasn't existed before. There are cultures on the earth that have been having  contact for 1000s of years, like Native Americans and Hindus, they've been talking about this in their culture for 1000s of years, but Western society has said these are just myths. This  is people are just making crazy stuff up. I think it's just the Western culture that is going to be the ones that are sort of taken by surprise. So the I think this the biggest shock is  going to be, yeah, this has actually been happening for a long time, and you're just becoming aware of it, that they've been here all along, coming and going, interacting with different cultures, different people in different  ways, throughout history. So one of the things that Bashar has said, and this was interestingly, just confirmed independent by a completely different psychic that I just  watched recently. Then it's the only other person I've heard say. This is Bashar said, one of the gifts that you're going to be given as humanity when you do have open contact is your  complete history of the things that you know nothing about that have happened on this planet for 1000s of years, and you're going to be given the recordings of all of that stuff so that you  know what your history is and what our relationship is. So that's going to be interesting to have that kind of information that goes back, who knows how far, to show us what's actually  been happening on the planet all this time, and what was real, what we'd be considered a myth, actually did exist, and all this kind of stuff, like Atlantis and all that. So it's going to be interesting to see what is contained in those historical documents.  What is Bashar take? Has he ever spoken about the Anunnaki? The Yeah, the Sumerian Yeah, in the Sumerian texts that the people don't understand, can you explain to who the Anunnaki is, really quickly, and what they've said,  The basic story is that hundreds of 1000s of years ago, an extraterrestrial species came to Earth that we refer to as the ANU, or the Anunnaki, in ancient Sumerian language, and basically  they were mining for gold for a particular reason that had to do with something of using it to balance out the climate or some situation on their planet that had gotten out of balance, and  it was a very large scale task, they found that the group that came here wasn't necessarily sizable enough to achieve the task. In the time frame they needed to so they needed help,  and they used their genetic and very advanced genetic technology to infuse their genes into the natural hominid that existed on the earth at the time, Homo erectus, or what have you, and  basically created Homo sapiens. And Homo sapiens were used as workers to help them mine the gold and all this. Now, a lot of  this is supposedly what's couched in biblical phrases of you know, man being made in the image of God, because these ETS were looked at as Gods because of their abilities and all this.  But from what I understand, this group was not supposed to have done that, and that was kind of outside of their laws, to have created use their genes to create Homo sapiens as a new  species that we were supposed to be left to evolve on our own. And they accelerated all of that and changed all of that. And so they were recalled, because, again, they had done something they weren't supposed to do. And from that point forward, the  rest of the ANU society realized, okay, well now that this group of beings, Homo sapiens, has been created. We're kind of responsible for them, so we're going to have to guide them for a while. We're going to have to see what they can do.  We're going to have to help them a little bit, but then eventually, we're going to have to kind of pull back, remain in the background, and see if they can make it on their own. So again, I think, in a nutshell, that is the story of the ANU as  that relates to the creation of Homo sapiens, and why there are such stories in ancient texts like the Bible, of people being, you know, cultures being led through the desert by the pillar  of fire and cloud and And Ezekiel seeing these, you know, this ring within rings coming down on a mountaintop and interactions between humans and extraterrestrials as guides to  help us build a culture that we would ultimately be able to sustain and take our place among, you know, the sentient beings of The galaxy. So, long story short. Has Bashar ever spoken about them?  What I just told you is what he said. Oh, that's all his stuff that that's basically, so that's basically. That's, that's not everything he said, that's, that's the nutshell Readers Digest version. Because, because, and for people understand, this is in in stone.  It's Sumerian texts and play tablets and things like that. This is, yeah, this is an old, I mean, it's up there with the with the Epic of Gilgamesh and that time period. So it's, it's ancient history, and so I always find it fascinating. I'm like,  why would they sit down and write a story? It was tough writing back then They're recording what happened. Basically now there's a lot of misinterpretations and misunderstandings and things  that have been lost over time due to a variety of destructions on Earth and natural disasters and all that. So we don't necessarily have the whole story. It's not necessarily clear. It's, you know, the ancient idea of the game of  telephone, one person says something, and by the time, it's completely different. So that's another reason why I think it's going to be so important that one of the gifts the ETs are actually going to give us is, here's the actual we're going to  fill those gaps for you. Here's the history. Now you have your entire history going back hundreds of 1000s of years, and now you know where you came from, so now you know where you're going, kind of thing, but you know. But there I have to ask you, because you and I are both  human, at least I think so. Are we? Are we, though I don't know, no that we're both. We're both of this time in this place, right? And we understand the realities of this, reality of  human nature, of also the power Of human learning. When I say human nature is the nature that human beings tend the traits that human beings tend to put out there. So ego  power hungry, Much of which is learning, not nature, right? Okay, so human learning. Got it human programming. So human programming, that's even better. I like that. So we both  understand human programming in the sense of ego, power, hungry, scarcity. I doubt that this is all going to be wiped away the second they show up, because if they provide new technology or  they provide this information, I can't believe our leaders are going to go, Oh, thank God. Let's just give you know. Let's everyone Kumbaya and get together. How long is this going to take for this transition?  A few decades, at least a few decades, if not longer. But again, that's the thing I. Was mentioning about the behind the scenes. There have been things going on for a while that people  are not talking about. We're already more used to this than we think. So. I think there already has been an exchange of  technology. I think there's already been guidance to some of this. So I think when the rest of humanity sort of joins the club, I think one of the things we're going to be understanding  is, yeah, we've been at this for a little while, and so we are now at a place where we feel comfortable telling you that we've already been ramping up for decades, and now we're  letting you in on the fact that we've been ramping up for decades. So it's not such a big transition to assume that in another few decades we could really all have, you know, be on  the same page at that point. But yes, it will take some time. Not everyone is going to jump on board. Not everyone, and a lot of people will probably freak out and all that kind of stuff, but a lot of people won't. And again, this is goes back to the  thing about the splitting prism into different parallel realities. Those that just can't handle it, they'll go into a different reality where contact doesn't occur. Those that can handle it will stay in the realities where contact does  occur. So we all have the ability to go into whatever parallel version of Earth suits us and suits our soul's path. At this moment, we don't all have to be subjected to the same thing. Let's, let's say that ET's show up and they knock on our door,  and everyone's, everyone's on CNN, it's on Fox, it's everywhere, and all of a sudden we have proof of there's something else out there. I gotta believe that's gonna throw a couple of ripples into religion.  Sure, there'll be ripples in every aspect of society. Of course, there will be, of course there will be. But a lot of truths, but a lot of truths that we've been taught and programmed to believe are going to be thrown out the window. And that's a fairly jarring scenario.  For people that are willing to throw them out. Yes, for people that are not now, we go back again to the parallel versions of Earth. I refuse to believe this. I refuse it's not true. I'm going to stay in the direction of an Earth where it's  not true. They will experience that. They will not have that exposure. They will not see those things. It will not happen in their version of Earth. If they are really in that much  denial that it would really destroy their worldview, they'll create a worldview where they live in it, and it has nothing to do with the worldview of other people who accept it, and it is literally a different world, literally a different world.  So it's very similar to the souls who believe in the flat earth concept, that believe it wholeheartedly, wholeheartedly believe that the earth is flat, even though science completely just basic math.  Yeah, actually, Bashar has explained the reason for that, psychically, psychologically, when consciousness expands to the point where you start to realize that physical reality is a projection of consciousness, you are sensing that physical  reality isn't real. You're sensing that physical reality is flat, and they're interpreting the idea that physical reality  is flat as a projection into the idea of how physical reality actually is represented in 3d space. That's the misunderstanding. They think that they're sensing that  physical reality is flat is actually the way physical reality in 3d space presents itself and it's not so they're interpreting the non reality, the non realness of physical  reality, in a literal context, instead of a metaphorical context, or an energetic context, or a consciousness context. They're just translating it into well, if physical reality is flat, that must mean the physical earth is  flat. No, in 3d space, it's not it's a ball, but it is flat as a projection, because it's on the inside of our consciousness. It's on the screen, on the inside of our soul, so to speak. You know, There is a there's a concept that's been tossed around a  bunch by people, and people ask me this question. I'd love to hear you and Bashar as I take on it, is that that there's a spiritual battle happening right now for Humanity's quote, unquote, soul and consciousness as it's going forward, the dark  and the light and that kind of stuff on that? Yeah, I don't want to see it that way. I don't think Bashar sees it that way. I. He understands, again, like we've been talking about, that there are people who are giving over  to fear as opposed to love. And therefore, you can say it's more of an internal battle rather than an external one. Everyone is playing a part. Everyone is on a path. Everyone is a path,  and you know, as a lot of ancient wisdom states, sometimes you need the darkness to see the light more clearly. So I wouldn't call it a battle. I would call it a play, a scenario  that by having negativity and having what appears to be darkness based in fear, it gives others an opportunity to see the light more clearly and head in that direction. I don't want to  frame it or define it as a battle, because that, in and of itself, implies negative energy. So I'd see it simply more as the  opportunities that soul has for growth using fear in a positive way to move forward. And Darryl, what advice do you and Bashar have for for people that are struggling with all these changes that are happening in the world today?  I want to remind everyone, whether you know it or not, that we chose to be here because this is an exciting time of transformation and change. You are capable of experiencing great change in your life in a positive way. Being familiar  with Bashar formula does help, but there are many ways in which to do it, but not to in any way, shape or form, give up hope to see what's going on again as a choice, to see more clearly what  you do and don't prefer, and to move in the direction of what you really do, truly prefer, and to understand that our greatest power is the freedom to choose. We have free will choose what  you really prefer, and your life will follow suit. Life is our projection. How we define it is how we experience it. The universe doesn't contradict us. Creation and existence doesn't  have a mind of its own. In that context, it is unconditionally supportive. If you say, I'm going to define this thing negatively, creation says, Okay, I support you unconditionally in your negative experience, but at the same time, if you say, I'm  going to define it in a positive way that can help me and be of service to me and be of service to humanity, creation says, Okay, I will unconditionally support you in that knowledge and in that belief and in that experience. It doesn't care. You're in charge.  Now I haven't asked you these questions in a long time. They're the questions I ask all my guests, and I think, I think I only asked you the first one, and that was a couple years ago at this point, so I'm curious to see how you answer them this time. Okay, what is your definition of living a fulfilled life?  Living your truth. For me, it's following the formula that Bashar gives, but it's being true to yourself and really understanding how things work, and knowing that you you are deserving. You're a part of creation. You know that you're  not judging except you're judging yourself. You're not being judged. So it's like, live who you are, be your true self, validate yourself, be of service to humanity that, to me, is living a fulfilled life. If you had a chance to go back in time and speak to little  Darryl, what advice would you give him? Don't worry, you're not crazy. There's going to be some strange stuff happening to you in your life. But don't worry, it's all going to work. Okay, you're going to be talking to Alex on his on his podcast.  What's a podcast? Listen podcast is the least your problem. You're going to be channeling. And that's a whole other conversation. What's channeling? Yeah, exactly. Just watch Star Wars. You'll enjoy it. Exactly. That's what you should tell  them. How do you define God or Source energy? All that is. I think it literally is everything that is. I think everything is made of it. There's no outside to it. It is everything that is, and we are part of it. What is love?  Love is, and especially unconditional love is the frequency of existence itself. That's our translation, our bodily translation of the frequency of existence itself is what we call unconditional love.  And what is the ultimate purpose of life? To be all the ways that all that is has of experiencing itself as you and to understand that We are all different aspects of the  same thing, to grow, to discover, to play, to enrich, to serve, to enlarge. You know, somebody once asked me, What  what are you? Not Who are you, but what are you? And also. Ultimately the answer that Bashar gave is the one I give now, I am you from another point of view. You are me from another  point of view. That's what we are. We are all that is from all these different points of view. That's what we are. So be what you are. Be yourself. Be Your true self. The hardest thing in  the world, is to try and be someone you're not, be yourself. And where can people find out more about you and the amazing work that you and Bashar are doing in the world? They can go to bashar.org, bashar.org, if they want to know  what I'm doing specifically with my passion in life, they can go to darrylanka.com, darrylanka.com, or they can see what I'm doing with my danger rooms, my escape room, by going  to boggledescaperooms.com. B, O, G, G, L, E, D, boggledescaperooms.com And for anybody who hasn't gone to boggledescaperooms.com, if you're in the LA area, that is where they are. There's going to  be, well, there's one right now, second one coming soon, and God knows how many more you insane you and your insane wife are putting together. I'm assuming you're the insane one. She's just like,  That's close enough to the truth. Fair enough. Fair enough. Uh, Darryl, do you have any party messages for the audience, Just what I've already said. You know, this is a journey we all chose to be here. You know, maybe hell, it helps sometimes  to think of it like going to a theme park, and you're saying, I'm going to go on this roller coaster, and it's going to be scary for a while, but ultimately, I know that it's going to be an interesting ride, and I'm going to grow through this process. So face challenges by defining them as fun. They  don't have to be a struggle. They don't have you don't have to suffer through it. Watch your definitions. Watch what comes out of your mouth, watch what goes through your head. Define things in a way. I'm not saying that you start calling negative things positive things, but stay in a positive state, because  then you can get a benefit from it, even if it began in a negative way. So just stay in that positive state, everything will fall into place. It does work. It really does work. Darryl, it is a pleasure and honor as always talking to you,  my friend. I'm looking forward to our next conversation. Hopefully we could, hopefully we can get you down to Austin one of these days. Not impossible. It's not impossible. One of these days, we'll do it. But  man, I appreciate your time, and thank you so much for everything you're doing in the world, trying to help awaken the planet, my friend. So I appreciate you. You as well. Thank you so much for the opportunity to share all this with you and with the public listening in Take care. Thanks.  Thanks for watching.

Ultimately, those in different vibrational frequencies will no longer be able to perceive or interact with each other.", "Answer 6": "Bashar likens the choices to a bunch of trains leaving the station in different directions, where for a while the tracks are close enough to hop from one train to another, but as they get farther apart, it becomes more challenging to switch trains.", "Answer 7": "Bashar suggests that the AI being created is something that we program, and we do not want that programmable AI to become self-aware, as that would essentially create a slave.

Hey Alex, how you doing today? I'm good, brother, I'm good. It's been, it's we haven't been on since, since, I think the beginning of the year or end of  last year is when you last time you came on, and it, it's been, it's been a few minutes. It gets people excited about when you come back. And every time we talk, people seem to like it. Well, I love being here. Yes, this is a great space that you  have created. And thank you for doing that. Ofcourse, my friend, of course. No you and we were just joking around, but you're part of the five timers club. You've been on the show five times already. So it's you're getting that robe. You'll get that Saturday Night Live robe shipped to you, sir. So  Thank you. Wait. You said I had to come down to Austin to get it. Well, I mean, I didn't want to say that publicly, but since you're saying it now. Yeah, So, so let's this. We've talked a lot on the show we've gotten,  we've talked about a lot of different subjects, but I wanted to kind of dive in this, in this conversation about a few topics that people keep asking me about, and I'd love to hear your point of view, and also what Bashar, Bashar thinks or has  said in the past about it. Right now, there seems to be a lot of insanity going on in the world with you think, you think exactly now, a lot of people say, Oh, the world's going  crazy. It's out of control. That could be said of every decade. I mean, and you've been around long enough I've been around long enough that we've seen, you know, I remember the 80s, 70s,  80s, 90s, everyone had their own little flavor. But it seems like it's always been this way. In many ways, there's always been wars, there's always been insanity, but why are people feeling it so much more now? And what makes this time different than others?  Well, I think globally, we're seeing more stuff happening because we're so interconnected, and so I think we're feeling the impact of knowing what's going on around the entire planet and  seeing all the crazy stuff all at once. And so it feels very overwhelming, but I also think it is an indication of the end of one cycle and the beginning of another cycle. And as Bashar  sort of intimated, it's like we're getting everything out of our system, out on the table, so that we can really see, do we prefer this? Do we not prefer that? What direction do we really want to go in? So it's kind of like we're not hiding  anything anymore. Everyone is very blatant about what they believe and what they think, and we're seeing the positive, the negative, the neutral, and every possible permutation of that all at once. So I think because we're seeing the beginning of  what Bashar really called the splitting prism, where a lot of parallel versions of Earth already coexist, and depending on our own vibration, that is sort of navigating us in  whatever direction our vibration is reflective of on those different versions of Earth. So I think one of the things that we're seeing that is a little bit different now is the idea of  what people really strongly believe is true and what is a fact. And Bashar has said that is actually in a one of the first symptoms of the splitting into different realities is that  both sides firmly believe that what they are saying is the truth, even though it's a complete contradiction of what the other side might be saying. So he's saying you are now finally actually seeing two different realities where two  people on different sides honestly believe that what they're saying is the true, even if it seems completely polarized to what the other side is saying. And both of those are real realities, and they will get farther and farther and  farther and farther apart until in the years to come, each side will no longer experience the other side at all. So I think that's to some degree what's happening. So you're saying that because right now, we're obviously, at  least here in the States and many other countries around the world too. We're very split. We haven't been this divided in a long time, you know, probably. The the mid 1800s last time we  were this divided on on things, it seems that we're so divided right now, like even when I was growing up. I mean, you know, the right and the left could work together. We might disagree fundamentally on things, on on world views, but we could  cooperate to get things done. There is just nothing being done now. And if, like, it's almost a demonization of the other side. Like, if you, if you like this candidate, then you're evil. It's not of an opinion anymore. Like you're evil. Or if you go  this way, you're like, you want the world to end so, Well, that's what I'm saying. It's, it's become very cut and dried, because you're actually seeing the effect of two completely different realities, not just philosophically,  literally, two different realities. We happen to be capable of still seeing each other right now. But that's getting more and more difficult, because eventually, like I said, in the years to come, whatever vibrational frequency you are,  whatever pathway you are charting into the different versions of earth that are more and more representative of what you choose and what you prefer. Eventually, you will no longer be close enough to the other reality to be able to see them  anymore. It'll be whatever you choose. You're going to find pretty much similar, like minded people in that reality as you continue in that direction, whether positive, negative or what have you. So it's really about this being the time of  choice and making the choice that is really what you want to align with, because that is what you're crystallizing as you move forward, and eventually that's all you'll be able to experience. Bashar has kind of likened it in the past to a  bunch of trains leaving the station in different directions. So the tracks are going off in all sorts of different directions. For a while, the tracks are kind of close, and you could hop from one train to another, if you change your  mind. But as they get farther and farther apart, it'll be more challenging to get on another train. You will basically be staying on the train you're on because it will be going so fast and it'll be so far away from the other tracks that you won't  even know there are other tracks to go to. So let me, let me ask you this question. Let's say I'm on one train and you're on the other train, and in my reality, there's a Darryl and there's an Alex, and you and I just happen to see things in a different way. Let's say you're going off to the right, I'm going off to the left, let's just say for  that, and we're off and we're off in my reality, as I start finding these more likely people, there's still a Darryl that lives in my reality is you mean so, not necessarily. So talk to me about that.  Again, only if our vibrations are somewhat generally similar overall. No matter what it is that we may slightly differ on, you have to have a general vibration in order to still  create your version of another person. Because, remember, we're not seeing each other directly. We're creating our versions of each other in our own reality. If my reality and your reality  become too different vibrationally, you may not perceive a version of me in your reality and vice versa. Now, whatever the mechanism is that we rationalize as to why that  happens can be very different. You could say, oh, he died. Or, you know, I don't know, we just lost contact, and I haven't seen him in years. I don't know where he is. I can't reach him. Somehow, it's all disconnected, and there's no way to reach this  person. So it can happen in a number of different ways, but the basic effect is, we're not in each other's reality anymore, and we're not creating versions of each other in our reality  anymore, if the vibrations are too different, but there are averages where you can still have some degree of your own personal perspective, as long as the overall vibration that you  share with Someone is similar enough to have a reason to continue to create a projection of them in your reality that's important for you to reflect off of. So it's a matter of degrees,  but there is a point at which those degrees are too different. And you know, I mean, there are people in my life already I totally have no contact with them, and it's just like they just sort of disappeared out of my life, you know.  So how about public figures, though, on both of our realities? So let's say there's a an actor, a politician, who is so out in front that it's just a worldwide, you know Reagan.  Okay, so it's Reagan. Reagan. Everybody knows Reagan. Reagan was in everybody's reality. He's no longer here because he's past of, you know of, but that was at that point, though. But there's others that have come up in the, let's say, in the political space, who have taken the mantle, sir.  For now, but again, even they can go away. I mean, it depends. You know, a lot of people who are in the forefront, who have a big presence make a big impression. They can have a  longer lasting echo in our lives. But like you pointed out, the reality is, Reagan's no longer here, so you can't really actually interact with him anymore, even if you remember  him, but you're creating that because of the level of his presence at that existed in our reality at that time, but there's no interaction. So does it? You know, you can remember him all you want, but he's not affecting anything really  directly anyway. So with that said, I mean, I don't know how many people from high school you still connect with exactly. You know, at that time in the moment when you were growing up with those people,  they were your world, they were friends, they were all that kind of stuff. But as you've gotten older, you kind of start moving in different directions, and you really don't know where they are. What happened if it wasn't for Facebook, I wouldn't even  know where half of them would be, right? So they've kind of just moved on, and in an all honesty, they're basically gone from my life. They're just like, they don't even exist in my  reality. So that I'm just trying to use that as an example for people to under kind of grab onto. Yeah! and that's the way it will ultimately become, where you just, I wonder whatever happened to so and so, you know, you just never meet them again in your life.  Yeah! I mean, look, I mean you and I work together in 13 years now. So 13-14, years ago, when we first worked together, I'm still creating a projection of Alex Ferrari, Yeah! Apparently, apparently, you and I have the vibration that we're  still to get because, in all honesty, and I've worked with so many producers and directors over the years, and I've worked on, you know, hundreds of projects. I don't talk to many of them. I talked to a handful, but not many. But yeah, for whatever reason, you and I still have a relationship. We still  talk to each other, we still connect with each other because, but in all likelihood, if I wouldn't have opened up a spiritual podcast and gotten to this frequency, I don't think you and I would have maintained that relationship. Does that make sense?  Not to the degree that we have, um, although you never know, because, you know, I like you. And I exactly too. I like you too. And who knows? In another reality, I could still be color grading and doing post, and you  would still be doing movies and not, you know, danger rooms, escape rooms. I call them danger rooms, the escape rooms. And there's a reality where you're still hustling as a filmmaker. I'm still hustling as a filmmaker, and we're and we're  still, we're still working together, and that capacity, Those are those people are not us. I feel that you and I might be having a little bit more fun. Well, I hope they're having fun.  I hope they're having fun too, but the filmmaking space has changed a bit. But anyway, that's a whole other podcast. In our reality. It has it might not have been there, And social media might have never been invented in their reality. That's right. There is a reality without social media,  Without YouTube. Imagine, yeah, or without a YouTube for God says, Can you imagine a reality without that? Now, speaking of  No, in fact, actually, I was only like a month ago, I read an technology, another question I get asked a ton about is AI and and the effects of technology and technological advancements, and how it connects to our spiritual evolution in the  coming decades. Because AI in the technology is going so fast, it's like monthly, daily, weekly. Things are changing. It's so insanely fast, I can only imagine what it's going to  be like in two years, 10 years, yeah, five years, 10 years from now. I mean, we're getting closer to the holodeck. I mean, we're not too far off my friend,  article. There's a there's one particular guy. I forget his name, but he's been responsible for inventing a lot of technology that Disney uses. And he has come up with a universal  direction treadmill, where you are walking, not going anywhere, but you can just turn in any direction, like you're going in that direction. And if you combine it with any kind of a virtual reality or projection around you, that makes it look  like you're going, you can walk for miles in that reality and never go anywhere. So they have now come up with the ability to make you feel like you're walking and walking and walking and not going and not actually going anywhere. The guy invented  a universal treadmill. It's amazing. Wow, yeah. And so it's basically like a a World of Warcraft kind of adventure that you're just like, or Zelda adventure that you're just exploring the world, and you can go wherever you want in this in this reality,  Right! And you're staying basically in the same exact space physically. Well, that's all happening, As opposed to those YouTube shorts that you see people with the virtual with the goggles on, and they run into the TV, or they punch their uncle, or they run things like that.  But considering AI Bashar has said something very interesting about that, and he is suggesting that we need to take two different paths with AI. On one hand, the AI that we're creating  so far is something that we program and and he's saying you don't want that programmable AI to become self aware. Basically,  it's a great tool, and it can be extremely beneficial for humanity in the future, as it already has been, you know, I mean, still has glitches that have to be worked out. But basically saying you don't want a programmable AI to become self  aware, because if you do that, what you have actually created is a slave, because now you have something that's self aware, that is forced to follow your orders. What you want is the  other path. Just leave that as a tool. If you want true sentient AI, then create a device that allows consciousness to express itself through that device, exactly in the same way that  consciousness expresses itself through a human brain, and let it be autonomous and have all the rights that a human has. And because it's true intelligence, it will work in whole systems  and never even think about the idea of getting rid of any part of the system like, Oh, I'm going to get rid of humanity. It just wouldn't think that way. But you have to allow that to be an autonomous being. And what Bashar has actually said about  that, he said, when you create that version of AI, you will actually be communicating with your own Higher Mind. So he's suggesting both of these paths simultaneously, rather than  trying to make this one programmable, AI become self aware. And how does that affect all this technology advancements that we're going through? How does that affect our spiritual evolution? Well, he's always said, Look, your technological progress  mirrors the changes that have already existed in your consciousness. You can't have any kind of technological breakthrough unless your consciousness has made a shift first, to be able to incorporate that idea and that  understanding, and then, you know, we then kind of start to get used to it and familiar with it and mirror it, and it reinforces itself. But the fact that we are capable now of  exploring the idea we call artificial intelligence, which to Bashar, is kind of a misnomer, because he's saying intelligence is not artificial. The device may be artificial, but intelligence exists apart from physical reality.  Consciousness exists apart from physical reality. So all you're doing is creating a medium through which consciousness that exists in the universe can express itself in exactly the same way you're creating an organic body with the brain, and  then consciousness expresses itself to you as a living being. So the fact that we are at a point where we're starting to work with that and investigate that idea, shows how much more  expanded our ideas of consciousness are, and that we are approaching the point where we really are starting to realize consciousness is not a product of physical reality. Physical reality is a product of consciousness.  And I've actually been playing around with that idea, because I was like, you know, if AI is like, I go to chat GPT, and I'll ask a question, or I'll ask her something, and I'll go, well, who's giving me the answer? Is it my higher self manipulating  the code to give me what I need at that moment. Is it consciousness? Is it something else besides just a bunch of zeros? That's where the spiritual element and synchronicity come  in, because even though the AI that's programmed may be able to sort through trillions of data bytes and come up with a reasonable answer that sounds like something a person would  say, the synchronicity involved in you getting that answer still connects to the spiritual dimension. So it is getting to the point where I think ultimately we will not be able  to separate what is technology and what is spirituality? It's kind of like what you know, Arthur C Clarke said so long ago, any sufficiently advanced technology is completely  indistinguishable from magic. So in this case, any sufficiently advanced technology will be indistinguishable from spirituality. The two are blending. And I think a. Is one of the fields where we will first encounter that crossover  between physical reality, matter and energy, and spirituality and consciousness. So I think that's why we're doing it. That's why it's now the leading, cutting edge of technology. In many ways, is because it's all about the next step in our  understanding of what consciousness is. Beautifully said, beautifully said. Now we've kind of hinted earlier about the insanity that's going on in the world. And I don't know if you've heard but there are some elections around the world happening this year. Are there? I think  You saw something on that on the newspaper? The old newspaper that I unfold every morning and read in my car As Billy drops it off at your front Good morning for your coffee. Thank you.  Exactly now, what is Bashar view of the outcome of all of these elections? Because it's not just the US. I mean, this is I heard 50% of the countries in the world are having elections this  year, which is a massive shift in ideology, a massive shift in energy frequency. What is his what is his vibe on this? As I said, He's saying, this is the time of choice. It is time  to choose. So you are being given all of these opportunities, all of these offerings, all of these different ways of looking at things. And you get to decide what really works here, what is representative of what I prefer  in my life, what is in alignment with soul and truth and spirit or not. So you get to decide what it is you want to hook up  to, what it is, what train, like I said, you want to get on, and what direction it's going in, and it'll take you there. But you have to make a decision, because this is the time of choosing, and there probably won't be that much longer that  we get the freedom to just completely choose one way or the other. We will always still have the freedom to choose things. But again, as we crystallize and navigate in a certain direction, then the choices will be mostly germane to that direction and  that frequency, rather than something that is completely the opposite. One of the things I always found interesting that Bashar said one time when someone asked him about he says, you know, do you? He was asked, you know, do you, do you ever experience any kind of negativity in your society? And  he said, No. He said, It's actually at this point, we've been choosing positive energy, positive experiences, for so long, it's actually a challenge to choose something else. It's  actually difficult for them to go in a negative direction, because there's so much energy momentum in our society between experiencing connection to Source, connection to their souls, they can't. It's almost like they can't forget who they  are anymore. There's just too much inertia behind that direction for them. So the idea they know that a negative choice is always available, theoretically to them, because  everything is always available, they just don't have the same propensity that we do for being able to choose negativity, because there is just so much energy behind the fact that  they've been choosing positive experiences literally for 1000s of years in their society. So it's just doesn't make sense to go in that direction. It's like it would be like trying to swim up a waterfall for them. With a lot of these elections that are happening, these  choices that are happening, it seems that a lot of the older systems are starting to show cracks. Are starting to to start to flounder a bit. I always use the Catholic Church as an example that has definitely does not have the power that it once  was, or once did. It was Almighty at one point. It was essentially the Roman Empire transformed. So where does Bashar and your you as well see the balance of not only power,  but of frequency shifting in these coming years and decades, of these old systems coming down, these new systems coming up. What's your what's your take and Bashar take on it?  Well, both Bashar and actually a couple of very well known psychic people who have pretty good track records have basically said that we're going through a 30 year reset from  2020, to 2050, and it is the resetting of humanity. We're at the end of a cycle, the beginning of a new one, and we are now being given opportunities to go in entirely  new directions. So I And again, remember, as Bashar says, we never actually. Change the world we're on. We are constantly shifting to new parallel versions of Earth. So again, the  changes that we see are not happening to the earth we used to be on. That is gone. We are constantly shifting to a new earth. This is a new earth. This is a new earth. This is a new earth, literally, not metaphorically, we are shifting  billions of times a second. In the course of this conversation, we have gone through billions of parallel realities. That's what time is. Time is a side effect of going through these different realities that our consciousness focuses on, like going like a  projector, like going through frames on a film strip. It just goes so fast. We don't see the blur. We don't we just don't know that it's shifting frame by frame by frame, billions of times a second. So it's going to go in whatever direction is  determined by the energy of each and every individual person. They're going to experience their own reality going in whatever direction is commensurate with their vibrational frequency. So that's what he sees. That's what I see happening.  So with this, because, as you're talking about parallel realities, I mean, the first thing that pops into my mind is the multiverse, quantum physics, and, of course, Marvel. Who's  brought that idea to really has brought that idea to the masses. Because before then, it really that wasn't it was a really geeky comic book thing or sci fi thing to talk about parallel realities in the multiverse. But now, I mean Deadpool and  Wolverine just came out, and that's all about different. He saw it. He saw it well, I look at the look at the Doctor Strange movie before that, the multiverse madness. The madness in the multiverse, yeah, yeah, it's just constant.  So now there's and now it just seems to be growing more and more, both in both DC and Marvel into these multi multiverse versions And Star Trek and all that. Right, exactly.  But, yeah, but that's what I was saying. It, it, it is already in our consciousness. So now it's leaking into all of our media, because it's already being accepted by our consciousness as something that is real. We understand it. And therefore you  always start to see it a lot of times, first in our art, in our media, then, you start to really see the practical applications coming into our technology. So it's getting there. And that's  another thing that I think will happen with artificial intelligence, is it'll probably be the thing that absolutely proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt that parallel realities exist. I mean, Bashar has a very simple way of explaining that  there's a proof that parallel realities exist. And I don't want to get too technical, but you're familiar with, and a lot of people are familiar with, the scientific proposal that there is such a thing as a unified theory of everything, right?  Everything is an expression of one thing. So science, in a sense, and physics in particular, is a reductive practice. We're reducing things down to the simplest, simplest,  simplest possible form, so that there will ultimately be one equation that is the simplest possible thing that describes every effect we see in reality. So Bashar is saying, Look, if  you're going to actually have a reductionist approach, well, you can't just reduce the forces in nature. You also have to reduce space and time themselves to the simplest possible idea of what  time and space are. So the simplest possible version of space is a single dimensionless point. The simplest possible reduction of time is a single, timeless moment. So if you  actually have the reality being a single, dimensionless point which he calls here and a single, timeless moment which he  calls now, here and now, right? So if we actually are experiencing truthfully, only a single place and a single  moment, then explaining how we experience different locations and different moments in time already means that you're looking at the same moment and the same place from different  perspectives to create the illusion of different places and different moments, and therefore the very fact that we experience different locations and different moments is itself a  definition of the existence of parallel realities. Does that make sense? Absolutely. Oh. So glad. Completely crystal clear. Daryl,  good. I'm sure people listening, going right, like, Oh, I understand quantum physics stuff. It does make sense. It does make sense, and it does make sense. And that's and we could go so far down this rabbit hole.  Yeah, like I said, I don't want to get into it too far. I know it's a little heavy, but nevertheless, Nevertheless, it's there. It's simple. It's simple.

Exactly! That's a great lie. My favorite part is, of those  movies is an end game where they talk about traveling time, and they're like, and everyone's Yeah, they're only referring to Back to the Future Terminator. Like, that's not the way time travel works, right? The scientist is explaining, like,  No, you go back and that's your new reality. So the old reality doesn't exist anymore. So you can't, you can't change your past, yeah, like, So back to the future. Was just BS, like, it's a movie,  Right! All of these, that's, that's the direction that we go in. And I think I've asked you this before, but for people who didn't see those other episodes, the Mandela Effect is us  starting to see those shifts in our realities. Yes, now not every single case of that. Of course, course, something could just be I forgot. How it I forgot. Yeah, I forgot, or there's something wrong with my brain  chemistry. But yes, I do believe some of them are indicative of the fact that two different people literally are remembering two literally different parallel reality histories simultaneously. And that's part of the overlap that I'm talking  about that's still going on there is bleed through and leakage from different parallel realities, because our consciousness is expanding enough to contain the idea that there's more than one reality, and as soon as our consciousness  starts considering that, we start experiencing some leakage, some bleed through from other realities. It's like we widened our bandwidth, because physical parallel realities are only separated by bandwidth, a frequency of energy.  If you're enjoying this conversation, I invite you to go deeper down the rabbit hole with me on next level soul TV. It's packed with exclusive content, like live special guests, Q and A's daily podcasts, commercial free access to the entire next  level soul catalog, early access to episodes before they air, and special meditations you won't find anywhere else. We will be adding new exclusive content every month, plus you can connect with me during my monthly live streams. Just go to  nextlevelsoul.com/subscribe and join our soulful community today, I'll see you on the inside. In not even very much like television where one program is  separated from another by the minutist change in the frequency when you change the channel and now you get a different program, but our bandwidth is expanding, so it's suddenly like we have a television where suddenly you're looking at the overlap of two or  three different programs on the same screen at the same time. So that's what's happening in physical reality. And I think the Mandela Effect is the beginning of recognizing that. And I think that's responsible for other phenomena too, like  deja vu and things like that, where we're going, Okay, I'm perceiving a reality that might not be exactly the same in the same time frame that mine is, it might be already ahead of mine,  and therefore mine hasn't caught up yet. So I'm perceiving that. And so it suddenly feels like, wait a minute, I I've seen this before, when it finally catches up, because you have seen it before in the other parallel reality, and your reality  finally caught up, and so now it feels familiar, like you know exactly what's going to happen because you've seen it before. So that could be one reason for deja vu. There are others, but they all involve the idea of multiple dimensions.  But let's just let's just be clear. Ed McMahon did work for publishers, clearing house, and he did show up at doors with checks for, like, a million dollars for people. Am I wrong? I don't know. Oh come on, stop it. You know you, you remember that? You  remember? Ed McMahon, yes, I remember. There's the, if you, if you guys, anyone listening, wants to go down a rabbit hole, type in Mandela Effect. Ed McMahon, and there will be clips. This is interesting. I'd love to hear your thought on  this. There's clips from TV shows, yeah, where he gets starred, and what did he do when he guest starred, showed up at someone's front door with a giant check, even though, in the reality that you and I are in right now, Ed McMahon never  worked for publishers. Were in house, and he never showed up at anyone's doorstep. But yet, there's a swath of people who do remember that from the 80s, from the 80s and the 90s, like the balloons and McMahon would show up. There's a check. So there's  actual video proof that he did stuff like this. What do you what's your thoughts on that? Again it's the same thing. There's overlap right now there's bleed. So there's bleed, there's bleed so we can still  see both realities or three or four, and that will eventually crystallize in one direction or another. But right now, there's overlap, there's bleed through.  It's Berenstein Bears, by the way anyway, not bear stain. It's ridiculous. It's Berenstein Bears. But there's a third reality where it's Baron Stein.  There might be but in this reality is Berenstein Bears. I'm just throwing it out there. I'm tired, I don't want to talk about anymore, and it's Luke I am your father. It's not. I am your father. I can't, I can't know what the video say. It's no, I am your father.  But you see, you think, I think it's Luke, I am your father. Because everyone says that. That's the way people talk. People say a lot of things. That's very true, especially in this reality, but I'm pumped. But anyway,  Moving along, Okay, moving along, as our realities are getting Our realities are starting to move up, we have to bring it  back together. So what guidance can Bashar give us in navigating a possible economic challenge that might occur moving forward,  because there is a we're all due for something to happen. It's, you know, oh, wait. Was a long time ago, so we haven't had a correction in a long, long time. And just by the nature of ideomy, doesn't,  Yeah well, I mean, we are definitely moving toward a different style of understanding of what it means to have an economy. And I mean, basically in the future, I don't know how  far away this may be, but it'll be something like what works on his world, which is they operate on pure synchronism. They operate on the idea that there are many forms of abundance and  support, and while money on Earth is one valid symbol of exchange, there are many symbols of exchange that are equally valid. So I think ultimately, he's saying it, your economy  will be based on the people themselves. It's almost like going backwards to go forwards where we used to have more of a a trade economy. I have something you need. You have  something I need, but in a hyper synchronous sort of style in the future where you wind up exactly where you need to be, exactly when you need to be there, interacting with exactly who you  need to interact giving them exactly what they need and taking from them exactly what you need simultaneously. This is how his reality works. Now that may be years, maybe even decades  away or longer for us, hundreds of years, but in the meantime, he's saying, Look, if you start relaxing your focus on what support means, then you can open up to the many forms of  abundance that exist in your society, instead of just focusing on money being the only path. And maybe you think it's the easiest path to achieve certain things that he said, That's not always true. So he's saying, yes, okay, fine. Money  is one symbol of abundance on your planet, but so is having something to trade, so is being given a gift. So is imagination, so is synchronicity, so is communication. So the idea is,  when you allow every single one of those and other forms of support and abundance to be equal to each other, and you don't focus on only one being more important, more necessary  or more valid. Then when you're following your passion, which is part of his formula, whatever form of abundance and support needs to be there to allow you to move forward in the most  effortless way, is what will come to you, and maybe even a combination of those things. So you might get a little money. Then maybe someone will come and give you a gift, and maybe someone will say, Hey, I have this thing to trade. And so all  the forms of abundance that can be there will come maybe 30% of this, 20% of this, another 40% of that, and they'll work together to form the 100% support and abundance you need  to be able to keep moving forward and keep acting on your passion and keep living your life in a supported way. So for him, it's about relaxing your definition of what constitutes  abundance and support and letting all the forms be equal, so that you're not shutting the door through which some form may come to you that may actually be the path of least resistance. Because while you're insisting that it's got to be this, it  could actually be over here. And I know that Bashar, many times, has told a story, and I may have told it to you before, I don't remember. I will keep it brief for those that have heard it, but it's a great example of that what he's talking about. Because  I have a friend who is a brilliant photographer, and she's a perfect example. You know what I'm talking about. Yeah, go ahead, yeah. Do you mind if I tell the story? Oh absolutely. It's a great story. It's a fantastic story. So her dream was to go around the world, fly around the world,  and photograph all of the sacred sites, you know, pyramid, Stonehenge, what have you. She didn't have any money to do that, but she understood that she shouldn't let that stop her having from having the dream. So by by staying in a positive  state, she had an inspiration and an inspiration that most people would have called insane and crazy, and it'll never work. But again, she didn't think that way. She said, All right, I'm I'm staying positive. I know there's some way to achieve  this. And so by staying in a positive state, she gets this inspiration. And her inspiration was, I'm going to go to the airlines and I'm going to ask them to fly me around the world to all these sacred sites for free. So she knew that there  needed to be some form of exchange, some equal give and take. So when she went to the airline with her proposal, she said, Look, if you fly me around to all these beautiful places, I will take these gorgeous photographs. Here's a sample of the photographs I've already taken. You can see how wonderful  they are, and I will let you use them in your brochures to attract tourists to your airline to fly to these places. Well, they not only said yes, they actually paid her to do this, flew her around the world, put her up in the best hotels, fed  her like a queen. She not only made money, she didn't spend any of her own money. She lived her dream because she had the wherewithal to stay in a positive state and receive an inspiration that while most people would have called it crazy and that would never work, she didn't let that stop her. So  she trusted that there were other forms of exchange and other forms of abundance that could allow her to live her dream, if she wouldn't restrict herself to what most people think is the only way you can get anything done. That is what  happened in our real, physical reality. It's a real, living example of how it works when people broaden their definition of what it means to be abundant and have that kind of an economy.  That's such a beautiful story. I love that story. Now, what is your and Bashar perspective on the future of religion? Because religion has done a lot for us over the years, good and bad,  but it seems like a lot of the older systems are starting to crumble, and even even the even the new generations you know, are not flocking or don't believe in the same right dogma and things like that. So what do you think it is?  You know, if you want a ritual, that's fine. If you use it as a permission slip to make yourself connect to something better, that's fine. If it works for you, that's fine, but it's really from my perspective and Bashar perspective about coming  back to a spiritual path, a direct connection to Source, rather than having to have a middle man or a middle woman tell you what is going on with God, Goddess, all that is,  whatever you want to call it. It's about knowing that we are aspects of existence, that we are reflections of the one of source. So it's a more direct relationship to have a spiritual  relationship, rather than a religious one. It's sort of a one step removed thing in religion, because you're sort of putting a ritual in between you and a direct connection to Source. But again, if it works for people to get them into a  proper state, that's fine. It's just that. Bashar looks at all of that as what he calls a permission slip. So that means you're using a technique, you're using a tool, a discipline, a ritual, an object, to give yourself permission to be more  of who you are, to be more connected to source in whatever way, shape or form you want to label that. Whereas spirituality is simply without the middleman, without the ritual, it's just a direct feeling, a direct connection, a direct, energetic  download, shall we say, and communion, if you want to use that word with all that is so I think that's where we're heading in general, or at least a certain frequency is heading in that direction.  And these are going to be the new forms of spiritual expression for I think. Yes, I think so. Because, again, look at, you know? I mean, when I started the idea of being a channel, I mean, that was just crazy, crazy, crazy. Now, at the very least,  I'm not saying everyone accepts that it's a real thing, but it still made its way into our language. It's like, oh, I'm channeling this. I'm channeling that, you know. So it's not so crazy anymore. People are beginning to understand it's a  natural state of being. You're just getting into a state where you're making more connections, more associations. You're synthesizing information more efficiently, more quickly. You're downloading information from wherever your own higher  consciousness, your unconscious, your subconscious, whatever you want to call it, but it is a true altered state, and we've measured that and and we've done it scientifically, and we can see that there are differences in the brain when you're in a  channeling state, which is called gamma. So it is becoming something that people understand. It's just like the idea of meditation. It's just like the idea of getting into a zone, you know, and stuff like that. It is an altered state,  and you can do different things, and you have a different perspective in that altered state. So I think we've learned that it's not so woo, woo. It's not so mysterious. And I think that's kind of where spirituality is going as well.  It's like, okay, you know, I'm this spiritual being. I'm starting to think of myself more as a spirit having a human experience, rather than a human having a spiritual experience. And we're starting to open up to the idea that consciousness is  not necessarily originate in physical reality, but is beyond that to begin with. So I think it's all blending together into a more direct relationship with existence, with all that is  With Bashar, what is his experience with spiritual expression? I mean, I doubt that there's religion where he's at No, no, there's nothing like that there. So what is it for him? What is He? Is it just direct connection all the time. Just direct connection.  All the time. I mean, he's, you know, he has said, you know, if you want to think of our civilization, he said it's, it's, it's not a full picture to just imagine a bunch of aliens  walking around on the planet in the science fiction sense. He said, our daily reality is as if we're walking through multiple dimensions of a dream. He said, I can't even necessarily fully  describe it to you. We interact with spirits. We interact with the universe. It's it's a direct experiential thing. He said, I mean, the crudest way you could explain it is, we're constantly  on drugs. We're constantly hallucinating. But they know the hallucinations are real, so it's you know it. They are constantly experiencing things we would think of as hallucination  hallucinations, but they're seeing the true multi dimensional nature of existence, and they are walking through it every day. They're living it. Every day. They can see multiple  dimensions. They can see spirit. They can see other kinds of beings. It so for when, when he's describing ideas to us, when he's describing techniques to us, like the formula that he  shares with all of us. He's saying, Look, I'm not giving you a philosophy. I'm describing what I see in terms of how the universe is structured, how it works, how you create your reality experience, just the same way that if you're holding  a red rose and I ask you what color it is, you go, Well, it's a red rose. I go, Well, is that your opinion? Is that a philosophy? Is that a belief that no, I'm observing the rose is red. So that's what I'm giving you. Is an observation.  I'm giving you a description of something we can see. So it's much more than just a philosophy. And his reality is not nearly as dense as ours. Not at all. In fact, they're what they call quasi physical.  They have the traits of spirit and the traits of physical beings. So they are in their evolutionary path, almost becoming a non physical society. But they're still they still have physicality to them.  And there are societies out there that are within just spirit essentially. There are societies that are just energy, just light, just energy beings. Yeah, because, again, that's what consciousness is to begin with. But are they on this plane of existence or not? Different?  They can project themselves into this plane of existence, but they are not of this plane of existence. So they can project into it, but are not of it  Is is Earth and our reality that it's like the toughest school there is out there? A tough school. I'm sure there are tougher, but they. Have said it's rare. That's one of the reasons why there are so many  extraterrestrials interested in what's going on here. It's like a master graduating class for souls. So the fact that we have chosen to experience such an incredible degree of limitation,  and yet we can still transform out of it is something magical and amazing to a lot of extraterrestrials, and they are watching very closely what's happening here, because what we're going through, if we are one of the toughest schools,  then other civilizations can benefit from what we're experiencing and how we're transforming great limitation into freedom and darkness and delight and negative into positive. Because it's almost like they look at us and go, Well, you know, our challenges aren't anywhere near that great.  And if they can do it, we can do it, because we're ahead of the game already. So if they have the ability to find the light from such incredible darkness, then they're a good illustration  of how anything is possible. Are we? Are we the are we, like, the best reality show in the universe essentially? Yeah, in a sense, because, I mean, somebody even directly asked Bashar, that one says, like, do you have movies on your plan? He said, No, we just come watch you.  So there's no entertainment. There's there's no Deadpool over there. They just come over here and watch it. There's only live pool over  So my next question is, how does, how does Bashar interpret all the ongoing wars and conflicts going on in the world right now? I think we already discussed that. We're getting everything out of our system. We're getting everything out on the table so  we can see, is this what we want to have? Do we want to continue this? Are we going to finally do something about addressing the causes of this, instead of just looking at the symptoms and trying to put a band aid on things? You know? I mean, look  at what's going on in the Middle East. It's, you know, culturally speaking, it's like they're in a closed time loop. It's like, well, I'm going to attack you now you have to avenge my  attack. Now I have to avenge your Avengers of my attack. And now you have to avenge your avengance of my vengeance on. I mean, it just goes back and forth and back and forth forever and ever and ever, because no one is actually stopping to  address the causes of this with Ha, which have to do with issues of deservability and self worth, and, you know, lack of experiencing connection to Source, and lack of experiencing  love in our lives and all that kind of stuff and validation of the differences that exist in humanity. It's just we're never addressing the causes. We're only ever addressing the  symptoms. That's why, you know, I'm not saying that all Western medicine is bad, but that's why Western medicine is mostly concerned with pharmaceuticals and where they're doing nothing  but hiding and covering up the symptoms and addressing those but they're not really usually addressing the cause of what's going on with the diseases, except in very few ways. So I think that's an exact reflection and exact symbol of what's going  on with our society, is we look at that and we get emotionally caught up in it, and then we react to the symptoms, and we never get beneath those, to addressing why are people like  this? Why do we keep doing the same things for 1000s of years? Why are we stuck in this loop? We have to address the underlying causes, which we do very slowly, generation after generation after generation, but we've come to a point now where  we almost can't ignore it's getting so bad we almost can't ignore it anymore. It's like we've got to do something about this, because we're just going to tear ourselves apart. I think that's the lesson that we're starting to learn by all of this  stuff coming out all at once and feeling so overwhelming. If we don't do something about this, it's just going to fall apart. So we need to do something about it. And I think to some degree,  the idea of having these kinds of conversations helps with that. It opens up new possibilities for people, new perspectives for people to say, maybe there's another way here. Maybe we need to really understand what it means to  connect to source, to be a part of all that is and start really making choices that are more in alignment with what we truly are  as co creators in existence. So, you know, I it depends on who we are and what we're brought up with as to how quickly we might latch on to that idea. But I do think there is change happening,  but again, most of that will only be experienced by those willing to make positive changes. And do something about it, as opposed to those who are not really willing or are afraid to look within themselves and just keep doing the same things  over and over again. It's really kind of a psychological issue deep down. Darryl, when you started channeling Bashar in the late 70s, if I'm mistaken, right? Late 70s, early 80s.  Early 80s. 83 Yeah, okay, so when that when he started coming in through you at any point when I'm assuming you guys had conversations prior to just being public so you like you were talking to him, asking  questions as well? At any point during that time, did he ever predict not only what was going to happen in the world, but also what was happening with you and where this whole thing was going  to go? Because I got to believe in 8283 you're like, Okay, I'm on board. But this is kind of nutty, and no one is really understanding what's happening around here. Like, you know, there was a leap of faith, but there's a certain point, like, what do I do?  Yeah, well, that was, that was partly why I had been shown the UFO in 1973 because that started me a number one, realizing these things are real. Because here it is in broad daylight, 70 feet  away from me, so I can't deny that this thing exists. So having those experiences in 1973 is what made me do all the research, so that by the time 1983 came around, I would have  enough understanding to go, Well, yeah, many people probably see this as crazy, but I don't care, because I understand there's something to this, and I'm curious to see where this is going to go. So in a sense, it was more pre preparation that  got me to be able to be comfortable with deciding to see where this would go. And of course, now we know where it's gone 40 years later, but it was all the pre preparation that  really gave me the stability to really go okay. I you know, I know that other people think this is nuts, but I don't care, because this is what's happened to me. This is where my life is taking me, and I just really need to see what's going to  happen with this. So I jumped on board. Did? He did, but did he ever give you anything in regards to what's happening in society in the future? Like, hey, like, there's going to be, yes, there's going to be AI. It's very rare. It's very rare he has, he has left breadcrumbs  for me, for my personal journey, to figure things out. But it's very rare that he will make a prediction for society, because, number one, he says there's no such thing as a prediction of  the future. There are many probabilities. When someone makes a prediction, they may be psychically sensing the energy that exists at the moment the prediction is made of the  present, and they're saying, if this energy doesn't change, this will unfold, and it will manifest and it will come to pass. But predictions are predictions of the energy at the  present. They're not of the future. They are warnings, or they are, you know, announcements of what might happen, what might be probable if the energy doesn't change in  this moment, that means that some predictions being made known will render themselves obsolete if you don't like what they're telling you. So sometimes a prediction that doesn't come true doesn't mean that the psychic was wrong. It  may mean simply that everyone said, we don't prefer that. Let's change the energy. Whether they do that consciously or unconsciously, doesn't matter. If the energy changes, then the prediction will not come to pass. However, the few times  that Bashar has been willing to make predictions, it's as he's explained it, because the energy momentum behind this is so powerful it's unlikely to change direction. And therefore they  feel comfortable saying, Look, this is where the energy is going, not that you still can't change it, but it is got so much momentum behind it, we feel it's unlikely to change. So we're  preparing you for this, because it seems like this will happen. So here you go. Now, the three that I can mention, number one  was in 1998 and this is on a recording in 1998 he said, but before the end of 2001 New York would have a terrorist attack. Obviously, that came true. The second one was, I think it was a  year or two beforehand, he said, and this was obviously having to do with the elections in the United States. He said, In 20. 16. After 2016 everything will change, and you will look back  at things beyond that, that you will trace back to the fact that things changed in 2016 and will never be the same. That has obviously come true. Look where we are today. The last  prediction he has made, somewhere around the end of 2026 or the beginning of 2027 there will be some sort of a UFO event  that will let humanity know we are not alone. Now he won't say what that is, but he's basically saying this will be the true beginning of open contact, where you now have to consider the  reality that there are others in the cosmos, other than yourself. So somewhere at the end of 26 somewhere around the beginning of 27 something, some incident is supposed to occur that will kind of open our eyes to the fact that we're not alone in the ", "Questions Type 1": {"Question 1": "What will the upcoming sadna transmission discuss?", "Question 2": "How do psychics predict contact with extraterrestrials?", "Question 3": "What type of beings might humanity first encounter?", "Question 4": "How will initial extraterrestrial contact be presented?", "Question 5": "What historical understanding might humanity receive from aliens?", "Question 6": "Who are the Anunnaki according to ancient texts?", "Question 7": "What was the Anunnaki's purpose for coming to Earth?", "Question 8": "How does fear and love play a role in society?", "Question 9": "What is the ultimate purpose of life, according to Bashar?", "Question 10": "How can individuals cope with changes in today's world?", "Question 11": "Please provide a short summary of the following discussion"}, "Answers Type 1 (gpt-4o-mini)": {"Answer 1": "the upcoming sadna transmission will discuss what contact with extraterrestrial beings may look like when it happens.", "Answer 2": "Psychics predict that open contact and disclosure, including the introduction of extraterrestrials to humanity, is only a few years away, and this prediction has been echoed by several psychics independently.
